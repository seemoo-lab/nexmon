 * XXX - "isprint()" can return "true" for non-ASCII characters, but
 * those don't work with GTK+ 1.3 or later, as they take UTF-8 strings
 * as input.  Until we fix up Wireshark to properly handle non-ASCII
 * characters in all output (both GUI displays and text printouts)
 * in those versions of GTK+, we work around the problem by escaping
 * all characters that aren't printable ASCII.
