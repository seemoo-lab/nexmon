Jul  3 2009  Compatibility with modern gcc, fixed buffer overflow due to growth
             of OpenSSL SHA1_CTX variable from 64 to 96 bytes.
Jun  4 2009  Lots of cool stuff including reading hashfiles from stdin,
             new liberal handling for 4-way handshake data, -2 option, fixed
             NULL deref when dealing with radiotap packet capture headers.
Mar 20 2008  New support for OSX and FreeBSD systems; thanks to Dennis
             Herrmann for the FreeBSD patch.  Added "make install" support
	     with patch from Thomas d'Otreppe.  Made OpenSSL mandatory for
	     WPA support.  Added support for 802.11e QoS traffic.
Oct 03 2007  Added suppor for radiotap headers in packet captures.
             Thanks to Robin Wood for getting this started, and for the
	     kick in the pants.
Jan 01 2007  Fixed a segfault handling WPA2 networks (SHA1.len != MD5.len)
May 03 2006  Added support for WPA2/PSK networks.
Oct 20 2005  Minor fixes to handling PSK length appropriately.
Oct 12 2005  Added support to precompute the PMK in a hashfile with genpmk
Nov 02 2004  Changed name to coWPAtty, thanks T. Brian Granier for the tip.
Oct 12 2004  Fixed bug that occured from the lack of a multicast key delivery
             following the four-way handshake.  Thanks Seth Fogie for the caps.
Sep 22 2004  Fixed bug in parsing frames that caused the SPA to be incorrectly
             reported.
Sep 12 2004  Removed code to load words into memory before processing.  Added
             functionality to read words from STDIN to interoperate with John
             the Ripper or other tools.
Aug 21 2004  Fixed logic to handle incomplete four-way TKIP exchanges with an
             error message and exit.
Aug 20 2004  Added Makefile option to use OpenSSL's SHA1 functions instead of
             the assembler code - big performance boost from 4.2 to 9.09
             passphrases/second.  P4 3GHz gets ~47.4 passphrases/second.
Aug 19 2004  Optimized hmac-sha1 handling specific to pbdfk2 by caching
             repetitive values.  Resulted in 25% performance gain.
Aug 18 2004  Load words into memory instead of reverting to a read for each
             new word.  Minor performance gain.
Aug 11 2004  Merged patch from dragorn to use i386-optimized code from Ted 
             Krovetz.  My system's performance went from 2.37 passphrases/sec to
             3.13/sec.  Thanks dragorn!
