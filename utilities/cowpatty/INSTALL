coWPAtty - Brute-force dictionary attack against WPA-PSK.

INSTALLATION

Most users will want to just run "make" to generate the coWPAtty binary.
Running "make strip" will result in a smaller binary without symbols.

Note that the default settings in the Makefile assume you have OpenSSL
installed on your system.  OpenSSL has a considerably faster SHA1
implementation than the C or i386 assembler code included in sha1.c.  If you
don't have OpenSSL on your system ... install it.  It's at www.openssl.org.
