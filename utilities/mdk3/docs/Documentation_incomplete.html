MDK3 is a Wi-Fi testing tool from ASPj of k2wrlz, it uses the osdep
library from the
aircrack-ng project to inject frames on several operating systems.<br>
Many parts of it have been contributed by the great aircrack-ng
community:<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>1. Setting up your environment<br>
</big></big><big><big><br>
</big><big><small><small>MDK3 is a tool that "injects" data into
wireless networks. "Injection" is the possibility to send self-made
data through the air without being connected or associated to any
network or station.
MDK3 is used to send valid and invalid packets, which belong to the
wireless management and not to regular data connections. This is only
possible with this Injection technique. Sadly, this is something, WiFi
equipment has NOT been built for in the first place! To enable the
injection feature on your
wireless card, you possibly need modified drivers. A lot of work has
already
been done by several hackers (including me) to make these modified
drivers available for a lot of hardware. Furthermore, the new wireless
subsystem <a href="http://linuxwireless.org/">mac80211</a> in the
Linux kernel supports Injection out of the box for many drivers and
cards.<br>
To set up your driver for Injection, please visit <a
 href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org">www.aircrack-ng.org</a> and follow
the <a
 href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers">Driver
Documentation</a> there.<br>
MDK3 uses the drivers and Injection routines from this project and its
predecessor. Thus, all drivers listed there should work with MDK3.
(Some special hardware, like Intel Centrino (ipw2200) is NOT supported
since they can only inject data, and no management information!)<br>
MDK3 works on Linux and maybe FreeBSD currently, it may also run on
Windows, but you need very special and expensive drivers and hardware
there, so it is totally unsupported by MDK3 and aircrack-ng. MDK3 runs
best with a pretty
up-to-date kernel and drivers. Use the recommended drivers and patches (<a
 href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compat-wireless">compat-wireless</a>)
mentioned in the aircrack-ng Wiki.<br>
<br>
<br>
</small></small></big></big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>2.
Getting MDK3 to run (Compiling MDK3)<br>
<br>
</big></big><big><big><small><small>Some Linux distributions already
contain a precompiled mdk3 binary. Sometimes they are pretty old and
buggy. You are advised to always use the most up-to-date version, since
version changes usually have many new features and bugfixes.<br>
To compile mdk3, go to the directory, where you extracted the tarballs
contents and simply type <span style="font-style: italic;">make<br>
</span>To copy the compiled binary to your /usr/local/sbin directory
(installing it), type <span style="font-style: italic;">make install</span>
afterwards.<br>
mdk3 needs libpthread and libpcap. pcap is possibly not installed on
your machine, use your package manager to install the development
package for pcap (ie. <span style="font-style: italic;">zypper in
libpcap-devel</span> for SuSE or <span style="font-style: italic;">apt-get
install libpcap-dev</span> for Debian/Ubuntu)<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><br>
</small></small></big></big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>3. How
to use MDK3<br>
</big></big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><big><br>
</big></big><big><big><small><small>Using MDK3 is quite simple, since
it comes with lots of help screens directly included.<br>
You can easily access them by typing only <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mdk3</span><br>
MDK3 displays the main help screen. To see all possible options, type <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mdk3 --fullhelp</span><br>
To see only information for a specific test, type <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mdk3 --help</span> followed by the test
mode identifier (b, a, p, d, m, x, w, f or g)<br>
<br>
Before you can use MDK3, you need to setup your wireless adaptor. As
far as there are different driver architectures, the way to setup your
adaptor may vary depending on which driver is in use. To make this
procedure easy, it is recommended to use <span
 style="font-style: italic;">airmon-ng</span> from the aircrack
project, since it can setup almost every known driver correctly.<br>
Read the <a href="http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=airmon-ng">documentation
for airmon-ng</a> to learn how to set your WiFi card into the proper
mode.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">IMPORTANT: You need to set your device
to the channel where the target
AP/client is, otherwise it won't work! This is a very common error.</span><br>
<br>
To find APs and clients, it is recommended to use airodump-ng. Simply
start it with <span style="font-style: italic;">airodump-ng</span>
[your_interface] first, to see the available stations. If you have
decided
on one CHANNEL where to run the tests on, you should restart airodump
and
set it to STAY on this specific channel, so your card won't change
channels anymore to find other stations. You can do this with <span
 style="font-style: italic;">airodump-ng -c </span>[channel]
[your_interface]<br>
The good thing of using airodump-ng is, that you don't need to care
about setting your card up correctly since airmon-ng and airodump-ng
already did this
job.<br>
<br>
Your hardware is now correctly set up, and you can start using MDK3.<br>
<br>
Another important notice for professional users: Some drivers do not
correctly echo back injected frames to the system, thus your injected
packets won't be seen if you sniff on the interface on which you are
injecting. To check if the frames are sent correctly you need to setup
another inteface on the same channel and sniff the injected frames with
it! You can also use aireplay-ng's injection test to see if everything
is alright.<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"><br>

The different test modes</big></big><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">b&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Beacon Flooding</span><br>
<br>
AccessPoints send out approximately 10 beacon frames per second. They
are to identify the network. When you scan for networks, your card does
in fact look for beacon frames on every available channel. With MDK3,
it is possible to send those beacon frames, too. Therefor you are able
to create as many networks as you like, always keep in mind, that those
networks are fake, and nobody can actually connect to them. People will
see those networks when they scan with their WiFi device. Windows does
scan
automatically as long as it isn't connected and shows an info, if a
network is found. Additionally, this mode can be used
to hide a network by generating thousands of fake networks with the
same name as the original one. This mode has several options to set
network name, i encryption, speed etc. So read on to get familiar
with them:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -n &lt;ssid&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use SSID &lt;ssid&gt;
instead of randomly generated ones<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lets you set the
name of the network. Only networks with the given name will be faked.
This is used if you want to hide a network.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -f &lt;filename&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read SSIDs from file<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This lets you read the
names for the networks from a file. This way you can fake multiple
networks at once.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -v &lt;filename&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read MACs and SSIDs
from file. See example file!<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is used to fake
only a very specific set of networks. Every line in this file consists
of the APs adress and its name. See the example file fakeap-example.txt
on how to use it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -t &lt;adhoc&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -t 1 = Create only
Ad-Hoc network<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -t 0 = Create only
Managed (AP) networks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; without this option,
both types are generated<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select to fake a real
network, or an Ad-Hoc network with clients only. (networks
without APs, where peers communicate directly) or both.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -w &lt;encryptions&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select which type of
encryption the fake networks shall have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Valid options: n = No
Encryption, w = WEP, t = TKIP (WPA), a = AES (WPA2)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can select
multiple types, i.e. "-w wta" will only create WEP and WPA networks<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -b &lt;bitrate&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Select if 11 Mbit (b)
or 54 MBit (g) networks are created<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without this option,
both types will be used.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -m<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use valid accesspoint
MAC from built-in OUI database<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Usually, MDK3
generates networks with a random adress. But as far as not all adresses
are used by actual hardware, it would be easy to detect most of mdk3's
network as Fakes.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This option refers to
the adress database included
in MDK3 to generate only AcessPoints with adresses from known hardware
vendors. With this option it is hard to say, if a network is fake or
not.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -h<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hop to channel where
network is spoofed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This is more effective
with some devices/drivers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But it reduces packet
rate due to channel hopping.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This makes MDK3 to
change your card's channel to the channel where the fake network should
actually be. Good thing about this is, its harder to determine if this
network is fake, since the channel given in the beacon data matches the
channel the packet is send on. Bad thing is, your card needs some time
to change to a specific channel. So this slows down the injection
speed. You
could avoid this by generating fake networks on one channel only (see
-c option below), but in this case, the targets don't need to change
their channels in order to find the correct AP, thus they may find the
real
AP faster.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -c &lt;chan&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Create fake networks
on channel &lt;chan&gt;. If you want your card to<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hop on this channel,
you have to set -h option, too.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -s &lt;pps&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set speed in packets
per second (Default: 50)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More speed = More fake
networks.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLES:</span><br>
<br>
There is your WPA2 AES network named "Hack me" on channel 11,
supporting
up to 54 MBit with lots of clients. You want to confuse attackers
by generating some fake clone networks:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">mdk3 </span>[your_interface] <span
 style="font-style: italic;">b -n "Hack me" -b 54 -w a -m -c 11</span><br>
<br>
The b activates beacon flood mode, -n sets the name, -b 54 makes it 54
MBit, -w a enables WPA2/AES only, -m makes MDK3 only use valid adresses
so the attacker will have a hard time to filter and -c
sets the correct channel.<br>
Do not forget to set your card's channel
before your start such it! You could also use -h option for this.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">a&nbsp;&nbsp;
- Authentication Denial-Of-Service<br>
<br>
</span>When a station connects to an AccessPoint, it needs to fulfill
several steps of Authentication. The two basic steps are Authentication
and Association. The first step starts the whole process and asks the
AP if another station may connect to it, and lets the AP decide if the
new client is allowed. A MAC Filter would deny this request if an
unknown station would try to connect. In the second step, the
encryption is checked. Most APs use the Open mode, so the Association
Phase is always accepted, and the real check if a clients key is valid
is done later (i.e. in the EAP phase for WPA). The weak point of this
is, that you can start multiple requests and forget about them, but the
AP needs to keep those request in its memory in order to complete it.
This Denial-of-Service-Mode starts as much requests as possible and
keeps track of the answers, the AP sends. You can execute this test on
multiple APs at once, or you can select the intelligent variant, where
mdk3 does itself keep track about clients, and even re-injects valid
Data packets it intercepts from the network, so an AP may not be able
to distinguish real and fake clients, and may start dropping legitimate
ones to free up space.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -a &lt;ap_mac&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Only test the
specified AP. Otherwise mdk3 will test all APs found on the current
channel (you could use some other tool to hop channels to attack all
APs in range.)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -m<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use valid client MAC
from built-in OUI database, so the AP can't filter invalid adresses.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -i &lt;ap_mac&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Perform intelligent
test on AP.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This test connects
clients to the AP and reinjects sniffed data to keep them alive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -s &lt;pps&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set speed in packets
per second (Default: unlimited)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLES:</span><br>
<br>
You want to test if your own network is vulnerable to Denial-of-Service
attacks. So first, you try a simple attack to see how your AP handles
too many connected clients. Usually at a certain limit (128 or 256
clients), the AP denies additional clients. Cheap APs also tend to
FREEZE and need to be resetted, so be careful with this! Let's assume
your AP has 00:00:11:22:33:44 as hardware adress, this is the first
test:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">mdk3 </span>[your_interface]<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> a -a 00:00:11:22:33:44 -m<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>a activates the Auth
DoS mode. -a selects your target AP, -m makes mdk3 use only valid
adresses to make filtering difficult. After a few seconds mdk3 may show
one or mor of those messages:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">AP 00:00:11:22:33:44 is
responding</span>: Your AP is responding to mdk3's fake clients. This
just lets you know, that your test is working.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">AP 00:00:11:22:33:44 has stopped
responding and seems to be frozen after 157 clients</span>: Your AP
stopped responding to mdk3's requests. Check if your AP is still
functional. If not, it is vulnerable to Auth DoS attacks, and needs to
be reset if one occurs! You should request a fix from your vendor!</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">AP 00:00:11:22:33:44 is
reporting ERRORs and denies connections after 251 clients</span>: Your
AP stopped accepting new clients, but did not crash, and correctly
denies new ones. Your network is now FULL, but stiull functional.
However you cannot connect to this AP anymore until the fake clients
from mdk3 time out and the AP accept new ones again. There is nothing
wrong with that, this DoS condition is compliant with the IEEE 802.11
standard!<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Afterwards, you may want to try the intelligent test, that makes it
hard for your AP to distinguish fake and real clients. This causes a
constant Denial of Service for new clients, as long as the attack is
running. And as soon as a legitimate clients disconnects, he cannot
re-join the network.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">mdk3 </span>[your_interface]<span
 style="font-style: italic;"> a -i 00:00:11:22:33:44</span><br>
<br>

</span>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Created:</span> Number of fake

to the network</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Authenticated:</span> Number of

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Associated:</span> Number of

  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Denied:</span> Number of failed
cycles (because AP is full)</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Got kicked:</span> Number of
fake clients that once were connected but the AP sent Deauthentication
packets to</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Captured:</span> Number of VALID
Data packets that have been captured</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sent:</span> Number of Data
packets that have been sent to the network with a fake clients identity</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Responses:</span> Number of
responses the fake clients got after sending data</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Relayed:</span> Number of Data
packets the AP accepted from the fake clients (AP forwards incoming
packets so we know when it accepted one, if we intercept the forwarded
one!)<br>
  </li>
</ul>
In this example, the intelligent attack has been started about 10
minutes after the standard one. As you can see, the AP is STILL denying
any new client! So be careful when you test a network that cannot
afford some downtime!<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">p &nbsp;
- Probing<br>
<br>
</span>The IEEE standard defines Probe packets. Those packets allow a
station to send a request for a certain network into the air, with all
matching APs responding to it. With those packets you can check, if an
AP is in your range (ie. if you can reach it and it reaches you). Most
APs have a feature called "hidden SSID". With a hidden SSID, a network
cannot be "found" with Windows, and will be displayed on other Systems
as "Hidden". The beacon frames emitted by those APs do NOT contain the
networks name. Instead they either contain ZEROS for each character in
the SSID, or only a single Zero. In order to connect to such a hidden
network, an attacker must find out the networks real name. As far as
the network's name is being transmitted in plaintext upon Association
to the AP, an attacker could simply wait until some client connects to
the AP or disconnect an already connected one with aireplay-ng or any
other Deauthentication tool (mdk3 can do it too, Mode d), and wait for
it to reconnect (which it usually does instantly). However, if there is
NO CLIENT connected, the SSID stays hidden. With mdk3 however, you are
able to try SSIDs from a Wordlist or via Bruteforce. It sends Probe
Frames and waits for responses. If you hit the right SSID, the AP will
respond to you, and it's name isn't hidden anymore. If you are lucky,
the AP keeps the original length of the real SSID in its beacon frames.
mdk3 will detect that and will only try SSIDs that match.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -e &lt;ssid&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SSID to probe for - If
you know the target SSID already and/or just want to check if an AP is
in your range.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -f &lt;filename&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read SSIDs from file
for bruteforcing hidden SSIDs<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -t &lt;bssid&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set MAC address of
target AP<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With a target set,
mdk3 will only print responses from this network, and stops when the
Wordlist ends.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -s &lt;pps&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set speed (Default:
400)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -b &lt;character sets&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use full Bruteforce
mode (recommended for short SSIDs only!)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can select
multiple character sets at once:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * n
(Numbers:&nbsp;&nbsp; 0-9)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * u (Uppercase: A-Z)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * l (Lowercase: a-z)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * s (Symbols: ASCII)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -p &lt;word&gt;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue bruteforcing,
starting at &lt;word&gt;.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">EXAMPLES:</span><br>
<br>
Let's assume you got a pretty important network, that is well secured.
Lets say this network is only used a few hours each month, so an
attacker may not be lucky to catch a client authenticating to it. You
decide to add some extra security to that network by disabling the SSID
broadcasting. That way an attacker may not be able to connect to it,
since he doesn't know its SSID, and thus may not be able to run
Authentication Denial-of-Service attacks. You select a pretty short
SSID, but you add a special character to it, hoping that it cannot be
guessed: <span style="font-weight: bold;">aa1*<br>
</span>Let's test if this SSID can be decloaked by a Wordlist attack:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">mdk3 </span>[your_interface]<span

Sadly, your AP does only overwrite the SSID itself with ZEROS, not its
length tag, so mdk3 knows, your SSID is only 4 characters long.
Therefor, it tries only those words in the specified file, that a 4
characters long. Luckily, aa1* is not being found in the list, and mdk3
cannot find the hidden SSID. The attacker may now try to use
Bruteforcing, since the SSID is very short. Let's say he already tried
several character sets, and wants to finally try all possible
characters:<br>

This time, mdk3 is successful.-b lnus means, start with lowercase, then
numbers, then Uppercase and finally symbols. After about 2500 tries,
the SSID has been found, and therefor does not add much extra security
to your network. Consider using a longer one!<br>

- Deauthentication ans Disassociation</span><br>
<br>
If a station wants to leave a network, it sends a Deauthentication
packet to the AP to deregister itself from it. Additionally, the AP is
allowed to disconnect stations when it thinks it is necessary (for
example, the AP is full, and the oldest stations gets kicked from it to
allow new clients to connect). As far as those packets are not
encrypted our signed (if you are not using the new amendment <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11w-2009">IEEE_802.11w</a>),
an attacker can easily forge them to disconnect legitimate clients from
your AP. mdk3 is capable of creating different types of those packets,
with different options:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deauthentication from AP to
client:</span> mdk3 injects a deauthentication packet with the MAC
Adress of the AP to the Station, telling the station is has been
disconnected for unspecified reasons.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Deauthentication from client to
AP:</span> mdk3 injects a deauthentication packet from the Station to
the AP, telling the AP, the station is leaving the network.</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disassociation from AP to client:</span>
mdk3 tells the client, it has been kicked because the AP is full.<br>
  </li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Disassociation from client to AP:</span>
mdk3 tells the AP, the client is leaving the network.</li>
</ul>
mdk3 listens on the current channel for Data packets, extracts the
adresses of AP and Station from them, and sends one packet of each
type. Every second, a status message is displayed, if something has
happened.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -w &lt;filename&gt;<br>

MACs not to care about (Whitelist mode)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Put the MAC adresses

skip them<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Enable channel

mdk3 hops on channel 1, 6 and 11, and disconnects every station found
there. Most stations try to reconnect, however, almost no communication
is possible anymore, because they mostly get disconnected again, as
soon as they re-request their IP-Adresses with DHCP and ARP, which
triggers another Deauthentication cycle in mdk3. Use 802.11w if
available or some IDS to at least detect such attacks on your network.<br>
