_Description: Should non-superusers be able to capture packets?
 Dumpcap can be installed in a way that allows members of the "wireshark"
 system group to capture packets. This is recommended over the
 alternative of running Wireshark/Tshark directly as root, because
 less of the code will run with elevated privileges.
 .
 For more detailed information please see
 /usr/share/doc/wireshark-common/README.Debian.

 Enabling this feature may be a security risk, so it is disabled by
 default. If in doubt, it is suggested to leave it disabled.
