 Handling security fixes in source package wireshark

Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer and it's ability to perform deep
packet inspection in live traffic may encourage users to use Wireshark/Tshark
as a part of an intrusion detection or traffic monitoring system.
In that case, please note that Wireshark/Tshark may contain remotely
triggerable bugs causing crashes or allowing code injection.

Bugs allowing code injection will be fixed in regular Debian Security
Advisories, but fixes for pure crash bugs may be delayed.
