 * sometime later.
 *
 * This function should be as lightweight as possible since it executes
 * together with the normal wireshark dissectors.  Try to push as much
 * processing as possible into (*draw) instead since that function executes
 * asynchronously and does not affect the main thread's performance.
 *
 * If it is possible, try to do all "filtering" explicitly since you will get
 * MUCH better performance than applying a similar display-filter in the
 * register call.

 * The third parameter is tap dependent.  Since we register this one to the
 * "icmp" tap, the third parameter type is icmp_transaction_t.

 * function returns :
 *  FALSE: no updates, no need to call (*draw) later
 *  TRUE: state has changed, call (*draw) sometime later

 * How best to display the data?  For now, following other tap statistics
 * output, but here are a few other alternatives we might choose from:
 *
 * -> Windows ping output:
 *      Ping statistics for <IP>:
 *          Packets: Sent = <S>, Received = <R>, Lost = <L> (<LP>% loss),
 *      Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
 *          Minimum = <m>ms, Maximum = <M>ms, Average = <A>ms
 *
 * -> Cygwin ping output:
 *      ----<HOST> PING Statistics----
 *      <S> packets transmitted, <R> packets received, <LP>% packet loss
 *      round-trip (ms)  min/avg/max/med = <m>/<M>/<A>/<D>
 *
 * -> Linux ping output:
 *      --- <HOST> ping statistics ---
 *      <S> packets transmitted, <R> received, <LP>% packet loss, time <T>ms
 *      rtt min/avg/max/mdev = <m>/<A>/<M>/<D> ms
