Overview:
=========
The dissectors provided by this plugin allow the dissection of DOCSIS 1.1
Frames.  Captures of DOCSIS 1.1 frames can be facilitated using Cisco's 
Cable Monitor Features found on Cicso UBR7200 and UBR10000 Series Cable Modem 
Termination Systems.  Captures of DOCSIS 1.1 and DOCSIS 2.0 frames can be
facilitated using the ARRIS Cadant C4 and the ARRIS Cadant C3.
