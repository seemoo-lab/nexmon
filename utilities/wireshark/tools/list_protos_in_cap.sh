# List the protocols (dissectors) used in capture file(s)
#
# The Python script indexcap.py does the same thing.
#
# This script extracts the protocol names contained in a given capture file.
# This is useful for generating a "database" (flat file :-)) of in what file
# a given protocol can be found.
#
# Output consists of the file name followed by the protocols, for example:
# /path/to/the/file.pcap eth ip sctp
