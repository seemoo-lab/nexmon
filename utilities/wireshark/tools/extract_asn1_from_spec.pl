# This script extracts the ASN1 definition from and TS 36.331/36.355/25.331
# and generates asn files that can be processed by asn2wrs
# First download the specification from 3gpp.org as a word document and open it
# Then in "view" menu, select normal, draft or web layout (any kind that removes page header and footers)
# Finally save the document as a text file
# Example with TS 36.331: "perl extract_asn1_from_spec.pl 36331-xxx.txt"
# It should generate: EUTRA-RRC-Definitions.asn, EUTRA-UE-Variables.asn and EUTRA-InterNodeDefinitions
