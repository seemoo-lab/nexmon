== User Interface

[[ChUseIntroductionSection]]

=== Introduction

By now you have installed Wireshark and are most likely keen to get started
capturing your first packets. In the next chapters we will explore:

* How the Wireshark user interface works
* How to capture packets in Wireshark
* How to view packets in Wireshark
* How to filter packets in Wireshark
* ... and many other things!

[[ChUseStartSection]]

=== Start Wireshark

You can start Wireshark from your shell or window manager.

[TIP]
.Power user tip
====
When starting Wireshark it's possible to specify optional settings using the
command line. See <<ChCustCommandLine>> for details.
====

In the following chapters a lot of screenshots from Wireshark will be shown. As
Wireshark runs on many different platforms with many different window managers,
different styles applied and there are different versions of the underlying GUI
toolkit used, your screen might look different from the provided screenshots.
But as there are no real differences in functionality these screenshots should
still be well understandable.

[[ChUseMainWindowSection]]

=== The Main window

Let's look at Wireshark's user interface. <<ChUseFig01>> shows Wireshark as you
would usually see it after some packets are captured or loaded (how to do this
will be described later).

[[ChUseFig01]]
.The Main window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-main.png[]

Wireshark's main window consists of parts that are commonly known from many
other GUI programs.

. The _menu_ (see <<ChUseMenuSection>>) is used to start actions.
. The _main toolbar_ (see <<ChUseMainToolbarSection>>) provides quick access to
  frequently used items from the menu.
. The _filter toolbar_ (see <<ChUseFilterToolbarSection>>) provides a way to
  directly manipulate the currently used display filter (see
  <<ChWorkDisplayFilterSection>>).
. The _packet list pane_ (see <<ChUsePacketListPaneSection>>) displays a summary
  of each packet captured. By clicking on packets in this pane you control what is
  displayed in the other two panes.
. The _packet details pane_ (see <<ChUsePacketDetailsPaneSection>>) displays the
  packet selected in the packet list pane in more detail.
. The _packet bytes pane_ (see <<ChUsePacketBytesPaneSection>>) displays the
  data from the packet selected in the packet list pane, and highlights the field
  selected in the packet details pane.
. The _statusbar_ (see <<ChUseStatusbarSection>>) shows some detailed
  information about the current program state and the captured data.

[TIP]
====
The layout of the main window can be customized by changing preference settings.
See <<ChCustPreferencesSection>> for details!
====

[[ChUseMainWindowNavSection]]

==== Main Window Navigation

Packet list and detail navigation can be done entirely from the keyboard.
<<ChUseTabNav>> shows a list of keystrokes that will let you quickly move around
a capture file. See <<ChUseTabGo>> for additional navigation keystrokes.

||_Filter input_|The area to enter or edit a display filter string, see <<ChWorkBuildDisplayFilterSection>>. A syntax check of your filter string is done while you are typing. The background will turn red if you enter an incomplete or invalid string, and will become green when you enter a valid string. You can click on the pull down arrow to select a previously-entered filter string from a list. The entries in the pull down list will remain available even after a program restart.

After you've changed something in this field, don't forget to press the Apply
button (or the Enter/Return key), to apply this filter string to the display.

This field is also where the current filter in effect is displayed.

|===============

[[ChUsePacketListPaneSection]]

=== The ``Packet List'' pane

The packet list pane displays all the packets in the current capture file.

[[ChUseWiresharkListPane]]
.The ``Packet List'' pane
image::wsug_graphics/ws-list-pane.png[scaledwidth="100%"]

Each line in the packet list corresponds to one packet in the capture file. If
you select a line in this pane, more details will be displayed in the ``Packet
Details'' and ``Packet Bytes'' panes.

While dissecting a packet, Wireshark will place information from the protocol
dissectors into the columns. As higher level protocols might overwrite
information from lower levels, you will typically see the information from the
highest possible level only.

For example, let's look at a packet containing TCP inside IP inside an Ethernet
packet. The Ethernet dissector will write its data (such as the Ethernet
addresses), the IP dissector will overwrite this by its own (such as the IP
addresses), the TCP dissector will overwrite the IP information, and so on.

There are a lot of different columns available. Which columns are displayed can
be selected by preference settings, see <<ChCustPreferencesSection>>.

The default columns will show:

* button:[No.] The number of the packet in the capture file. This number won't
  change, even if a display filter is used.

* button:[Time] The timestamp of the packet. The presentation format of this
  timestamp can be changed, see <<ChWorkTimeFormatsSection>>.

* button:[Source] The address where this packet is coming from.

* button:[Destination] The address where this packet is going to.

* button:[Protocol] The protocol name in a short (perhaps abbreviated) version.

* button:[Length] The length of each packet.

* button:[Info] Additional information about the packet content.

The first column shows how each packet is related to the selected packet. For
example, in the image above the first packet is selected, which is a DNS
request. Wireshark shows a rightward arrow for the request itself, followed by a
leftward arrow for the response in packet 2. Why is there a dashed line? There
are more DNS packets further down that use the same port numbers. Wireshark
treats them as belonging to the same conversation and draws a line connecting
them.

.Related packet symbols

image:wsug_graphics/related-first.png[height="18px"]::
  First packet in a conversation.

image:wsug_graphics/related-current.png[height="18px"]::

image:wsug_graphics/related-other.png[height="18px"]::
  _Not_ part of the selected conversation.

image:wsug_graphics/related-last.png[height="18px"]::

image:wsug_graphics/related-dup-ack.png[height="18px"]::
  The selected packet is a duplicate acknowledgement of this packet.

image:wsug_graphics/related-segment.png[height="18px"]::
  The selected packet is related to this packet in some other way, e.g. as part
  of reassembly.

The packet list has an _Intelligent Scrollbar_ which shows a miniature map of
nearby packets. Each https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics[raster line]
of the scrollbar corresponds to a single packet, so the number of packets shown
in the map depends on your physical display and the height of the packet list. A
tall packet list on a high-resolution (``Retina'') display will show you quite a
few packets. In the image above the scrollbar shows the status of more than 500
packets along with the 15 shown in the packet list itself.

Right clicking will show a context menu, described in
<<ChWorkPacketListPanePopUpMenu>>.

[[ChUsePacketDetailsPaneSection]]

=== The ``Packet Details'' pane

The packet details pane shows the current packet (selected in the ``Packet List''
pane) in a more detailed form.

[[ChUseWiresharkDetailsPane]]

.The ``Packet Details'' pane
image::wsug_graphics/ws-details-pane.png[]

This pane shows the protocols and protocol fields of the packet selected in the
``Packet List'' pane. The protocols and fields of the packet shown in a tree
which can be expanded and collapsed.

There is a context menu (right mouse click) available. See details in
<<ChWorkPacketDetailsPanePopUpMenu>>.

Some protocol fields have special meanings.

* *Generated fields.* Wireshark itself will generate additional protocol
  information which isn't present in the captured data. This information is
  enclosed in square brackets (`[' and `]'). Generated information includes
  response times, TCP analysis, GeoIP information, and checksum validation.

* *Links.* If Wireshark detects a relationship to another packet in the capture
  file it will generate a link to that packet. Links are underlined and
  displayed in blue. If you double-clicked on a link  Wireshark will jump to the
  corresponding packet.

[[ChUsePacketBytesPaneSection]]

=== The ``Packet Bytes'' pane

The packet bytes pane shows the data of the current packet (selected in the
``Packet List'' pane) in a hexdump style.

[[ChUseWiresharkBytesPane]]

.The ``Packet Bytes'' pane
image::wsug_graphics/ws-bytes-pane.png[]

The ``Packet Bytes'' pane shows a canonical
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hex_dump[hex dump] of the packet data. Each line
contains the data offset, sixteen hexadecimal bytes, and sixteen ASCII bytes.
Non-printalbe bytes are replaced with a period (`.').

Depending on the packet data, sometimes more than one page is available, e.g.
when Wireshark has reassembled some packets into a single chunk of data. (See
<<ChAdvReassemblySection>> for details). In this case you can see each data
source by clicking its corresponding tab at the bottom of the pane.

[[ChUseWiresharkBytesPaneTabs]]
.The ``Packet Bytes'' pane with tabs
image::wsug_graphics/ws-bytes-pane-tabs.png[]

Additional pages typically contain data reassembled from multiple packets or
decrypted data.

The context menu (right mouse click) of the tab labels will show a list of all
available pages. This can be helpful if the size in the pane is too small for
all the tab labels.

[[ChUseStatusbarSection]]

=== The Statusbar

The statusbar displays informational messages.

In general, the left side will show context related information, the middle part
will show information about the current capture file, and the right side will
show the selected configuration profile. Drag the handles between the text areas
to change the size.

[[ChUseWiresharkStatusbarEmpty]]
.The initial Statusbar
image::wsug_graphics/ws-statusbar-empty.png[height="22px"]

This statusbar is shown while no capture file is loaded, e.g. when Wireshark is started.

[[ChUseWiresharkStatusbarLoaded]]
.The Statusbar with a loaded capture file
image::wsug_graphics/ws-statusbar-loaded.png[height="22px"]

* *The colorized bullet* on the left shows the highest expert info level found
  in the currently loaded capture file. Hovering the mouse over this icon will
  show a textual description of the expert info level, and clicking the icon
  will bring up the Expert Infos dialog box. For a detailed description of
  expert info, see <<ChAdvExpert>>.

* *The left side* shows information about the capture file, its name, its size
  and the elapsed time while it was being captured. Hovering over a file name
  will show its full path and size.

* *The middle part* shows the current number of packets in the capture file. The
  following values are displayed:

  - _Packets:_ The number of captured packets.

  - _Displayed:_ The number of packets currently being displayed.

  - _Marked:_ The number of marked packets (only displayed if packets are
  marked).

  - _Dropped:_ The number of dropped packets (only displayed if Wireshark was
  unable to capture all packets).

  - _Ignored:_ The number of ignored packets (only displayed if packets are
  ignored).

  - _Load time:_ The time it took to load the capture (wall clock time).

* *The right side* shows the selected configuration profile. Clicking in this
  part of the statusbar will bring up a menu with all available configuration
  profiles, and selecting from this list will change the configuration profile.

[[ChUseWiresharkStatusbarProfile]]
