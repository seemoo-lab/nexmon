== Telephony

[[ChTelIntroduction]]

=== Introduction

Wireshark provides a wide range of telephony related network statistics which
can be accessed via the menu:Telephony[] menu.

These statistics range from specific signaling protocols, to analysis of
signaling and media flows. If encoded in a compatible encoding the media flow
can even be played.

[[ChTelRTPAnalysis]]

=== RTP Analysis

The RTP analysis function takes the selected RTP stream (and the reverse stream,
if possible) and generates a list of statistics on it.

Starting with basic data as packet number and sequence number, further
statistics are created based on arrival time, delay, jitter, packet size, etc.

Besides the per packet statistics, the lower pane shows the overall statistics,
with minimums and maximums for delta, jitter and clock skew. Also an indication
of lost packets is included.

The RTP Stream Analysis window further provides the option to save the RTP
payload (as raw data or, if in a PCM encoding, in an Audio file). Other options
a to export and plot various statistics on the RTP streams.

[[ChTelIAX2Analysis]]

=== IAX2 Analysis

The ``IAX2 Analysis'' dialog shows statistics for the forward and reverse
streams of a selected IAX2 call along with a graph.

[[ChTelVoipCalls]]

=== VoIP Calls

The VoIP Calls window shows a list of all detected VoIP calls in the captured
traffic. It finds calls by their signaling.

More details can be found on the
link:wireshark-wiki-site:[]VoIP_calls[wireshark-wiki-site:[]VoIP_calls] page.

[[ChTelRtpPlayer]]

The RTP Player window lets you play back RTP audio data. In order to use
this feature your version of Wireshark must support audio and the codecs
used by each RTP stream.

More details can be found on the
link:wireshark-wiki-site:[]VoIP_calls[wireshark-wiki-site:[]VoIP_calls] page.

[[ChTelLTEMACTraffic]]

=== LTE MAC Traffic Statistics

Statistics of the captured LTE MAC traffic. This window will summarize the LTE
MAC traffic found in the capture.

The top pane shows statistics for common channels. Each row in the middle pane
shows statistical highlights for exactly one UE/C-RNTI. In the lower pane, you
can see the for the currently selected UE/C-RNTI the traffic broken down by
individual channel.

[[ChTelLTERLCTraffic]]

=== LTE RLC Traffic Statistics

Statistics of the captured LTE RLC traffic. This window will summarize the LTE
RLC traffic found in the capture.

At the top, the check-box allows this window to include RLC PDUs found within
MAC PDUs or not. This will affect both the PDUs counted as well as the display
filters generated (see below).

The upper list shows summaries of each active UE. Each row in the lower list
shows statistical highlights for individual channels within the selected UE.

The lower part of the windows allows display filters to be generated and set for
the selected channel. Note that in the case of Acknowledged Mode channels, if a
single direction is chosen, the generated filter will show data in that
direction and control PDUs in the opposite direction.

=== The protocol specific statistics windows

The protocol specific statistics windows display detailed information of
specific protocols and might be described in a later version of this document.

Some of these statistics are described at the
link:wireshark-wiki-site:[]Statistics[wireshark-wiki-site:[]Statistics] pages.
