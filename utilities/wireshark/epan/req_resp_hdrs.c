	 * RFC 2616 defines HTTP messages as being either of the

	 * Request and Response are defined as:
	 *     Request = Request-Line

	 *         | request-header
	 *         | entity-header ) CRLF)

	 *         | entity-header ) CRLF)
	 *         CRLF
	 *         [ message-body ]
	 * that's why we can always assume two consecutive line
	 * endings (we allow CR, LF, or CRLF, as some clients
	 * or servers might not use a full CRLF) to mark the end
	 * of the headers.  The worst thing that would happen
	 * otherwise would be the packet not being desegmented
	 * or being interpreted as only headers.
