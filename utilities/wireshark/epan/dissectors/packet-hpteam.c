 * According to the HP document at
 *
 *	http://www.hp.com/sbso/bus_protect/teaming.pdf
 *
 * the heartbeats are sent to 03-00-C7-00-00-EE in SNAP frames
 * in unnumbered TEST frames.  It says that the LLC header is
 * followed by 63 bytes of "Insignificant data" and the FCS.
 * This means that the SNAP header is part of the "Insignificant
 * data".
 *
 * The SNAP specification (section 10.3 "Subnetwork Access Protocol"
 * of IEEE Std 802-2001) says that *all* SNAP PDUs have an LLC
 * payload that starts with the 5-octet Protocol Identification
 * field, i.e. the OUI and PID.
 *
 * At least some Teaming heartbeat packets have an OUI of 00-80-5F,
 * which belongs to HP, and a protocol ID of 0x0002.
 *
 * If all heartbeat packets have that OUI/PID combination, and no other
 * packets have it, the right way to recognize them is by registering
 * the PID of 0x0002 in the dissector table for that OUI; there is no
 * need to check the destination MAC address.
 *
 * If not all heartbeat packets have that OUI/PID combination and/or other
 * packets have it, the only way to recognize them would be to add
 * support for heuristic dissectors to the SNAP dissector, register this
 * as a heuristic dissector for that table, and have it compare pinfo->dl_dst
 * against an address structure with a type of AT_ETHER, a length of 6,
 * and data of 03-00-C7-00-00-EE.  It is *not* sufficient to just check
 * pinfo->dl_dst.data, as there is no guarantee that it will be a MAC
 * address - SNAP frames can also be captured with "Linux cooked mode"
 * headers, e.g. on the "any" device, and those only have a destination
 * address for packets sent by the machine capturing the traffic, not for
 * packets received by the machine.
