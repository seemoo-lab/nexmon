/* packet-ieee8023.c
 * Routine for dissecting Ethernet packets with a length field (as opposed
 * to a type field).
 *
 * The name "ieee8023" is historical, dating back to when IEEE Std 802.3
 * had only a length field and expected all packets to have an 802.2
 * header following the MAC header.  Since IEEE 802.3y-1997, 802.3
 * supports either a type field or a length field, so it's no longer
 * correct to refer to "802.3" vs. "D/I/X" or vs. "Ethernet II" frames.
