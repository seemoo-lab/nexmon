/*
 * Note:
 *   There are four dissectors for the WAP protocol:
 *     WTLS
 *     WTP
 *     WSP
 *     WMLC
 *   Which of these are necessary is determined by the port number above.
 *   I.e. port 9200 (wap-wsp) indicates WSP data and possibly WMLC (depending on
 *   the WSP PDU).
 *   Port 9203 (wap-wsp-wtp-s), on the other hand, has WTLS, WTP, WSP and
 *   possibly WMLC data in that order in the packet.
 *
 *   Therefore the dissectors are chained as follows:
 *
 *   Port        Dissectors
 *   9200                     WSP  ->  WMLC
 *   9201            WTP  ->  WSP  ->  WMLC
 *   9202  WTLS  ->           WSP  ->  WMLC
 *   9203  WTLS  ->  WTP  ->  WSP  ->  WMLC
 *
 *   2948                     WSP  ->  WMLC (Push)
 *   2949  WTLS  ->           WSP  ->  WMLC (Push)
 *
 *   At present, only the unencrypted parts of WTLS can be analysed. Therefore
 *   the WTP and WSP dissectors are not called.
