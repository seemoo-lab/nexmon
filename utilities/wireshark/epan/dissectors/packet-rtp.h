   dynamic payload information. Internally, RTP creates the GHashTable with a wmem file scope
   and increments the ref_count when it saves the info to conversations later. The calling
   dissector (SDP, H.245, etc.) uses these functions as an interface. If the calling dissector
   is done with the rtp_dyn_payload_t* for good, it should call rtp_dyn_payload_free() which
   will decrement the ref_count and free's it if the ref_count is 0. In the worst case, it
   will get free'd when the wmem file scope is over.

   This was changed because there were too many bugs with SDP's handling of memory ownership
   of the GHashTable, with RTP freeing things SDP didn't think were free'ed. And also because
   the GHashTables never got free'd in many cases by several dissectors.
