# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute)

# The INPUT tag can be used to specify the files and/or directories that contain

# this location is as follows:

# TAGFILES = file1 file2 ...
# Adding location for the tag files is done as follows:
#
# TAGFILES = file1=loc1 "file2 = loc2" ...
# where "loc1" and "loc2" can be relative or absolute paths or
# URLs. If a location is present for each tag, the installdox tool
# does not have to be run to correct the links.
# Note that each tag file must have a unique name
# (where the name does NOT include the path)
# If a tag file is not located in the directory in which doxygen
# is run, you must also specify the path to the tagfile here.

# The EXCLUDE tag can be used to specify files and/or directories that should 
# excluded from the INPUT source files. This way you can easily exclude a

# The EXCLUDE_SYMLINKS tag can be used select whether or not files or directories
