/** this function attaches the tap_listener to the named tap.
 * function returns :

 *           message.
 * @param tapname    The name of the tap we want to listen to.
 * @param tapdata    is the instance identifier. The tap system uses the value of this
 *                   pointer to distinguish between different instances of a tap.
 *                   Just make sure that it is unique by letting it be the pointer to a struct
 *                   holding all state variables. If you want to allow multiple concurrent
 *                   instances, just put ALL state variables inside a struct allocated by
 *                   g_malloc() and use that pointer.
 * @param fstring    is a pointer to a filter string.
 *                   If this is NULL, then the tap system will provide ALL packets passing the
 *                   tapped protocol to your listener.
 *                   If you specify a filter string here the tap system will first try
 *                   to apply this string to the packet and then only pass those packets that
 *                   matched the filter to your listener.
 *                   The syntax for the filter string is identical to normal display filters.
 *
 *                   NOTE: Specifying filter strings will have a significant performance impact
 *                   on your application and Wireshark. If possible it is MUCH better to take
 *                   unfiltered data and just filter it yourself in the packet-callback than
 *                   to specify a filter string.
 *                   ONLY use a filter string if no other option exist.
 *
 * @param flags      is a set of flags for the tap listener.  The flags that can be set are:
 *
 *                      TL_REQUIRES_PROTO_TREE
 *
 *                   	set if your tap listener "packet" routine requires a protocol
 *                   	tree to be built.  It will require a protocol tree to be
 *                   	built if either
 *
 *                   		1) it looks at the protocol tree in edt->tree
 *
 *                   	or
 *
 *                   		2) the tap-specific data passed to it is constructed only if
 *                   		   the protocol tree is being built.
 *
 *                      TL_REQUIRES_COLUMNS
 *
 *                   	set if your tap listener "packet" routine requires the column
 *                   	strings to be constructed.
 *
 *                       If no flags are needed, use TL_REQUIRES_NOTHING.
 *
 * @param tap_reset  void (*reset)(void *tapdata)
 *                   This callback is called whenever Wireshark wants to inform your
 *                   listener that it is about to start [re]reading a capture file or a new capture
 *                   from an interface and that your application should reset any state it has
 *                   in the *tapdata instance.
 * @param tap_packet gboolean (*packet)(void *tapdata, packet_info *pinfo, epan_dissect_t *edt, const void *data)
 *                   This callback is used whenever a new packet has arrived at the tap and that
 *                   it has passed the filter (if there were a filter).
 *                   The *data structure type is specific to each tap.
 *                   This function returns an gboolean and it should return
 *                    TRUE, if the data in the packet caused state to be updated
 *                          (and thus a redraw of the window would later be required)
 *                    FALSE, if we don't need to redraw the window.
 *                   NOTE: that (*packet) should be as fast and efficient as possible. Use this
 *                   function ONLY to store data for later and do the CPU-intensive processing
 *                   or GUI updates down in (*draw) instead.
 * @param tap_draw   void (*draw)(void *tapdata)
 *                   This callback is used when Wireshark wants your application to redraw its
 *                   output. It will usually not be called unless your application has received
 *                   new data through the (*packet) callback.
 *                   On some ports of Wireshark (gtk2) (*draw) will be called asynchronously
 *                   from a separate thread up to once every 2-3 seconds.
 *                   On other ports it might only be called once when the capture is finished
 *                   or the file has been [re]read completely.
