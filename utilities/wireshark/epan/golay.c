/* Encoding matrix, H

   These entries are formed from the matrix specified in H.223/B.3.2.1.3;
   it's first transposed so we have:

   [P1 ]   [111110010010]  [MC1 ]
   [P2 ]   [011111001001]  [MC2 ]
   [P3 ]   [110001110110]  [MC3 ]
   [P4 ]   [011000111011]  [MC4 ]
   [P5 ]   [110010001111]  [MPL1]
   [P6 ] = [100111010101]  [MPL2]
   [P7 ]   [101101111000]  [MPL3]
   [P8 ]   [010110111100]  [MPL4]
   [P9 ]   [001011011110]  [MPL5]
   [P10]   [000101101111]  [MPL6]
   [P11]   [111100100101]  [MPL7]
   [P12]   [101011100011]  [MPL8]

   So according to the equation, P1 = MC1+MC2+MC3+MC4+MPL1+MPL4+MPL7

   Looking down the first column, we see that if MC1 is set, we toggle bits
   1,3,5,6,7,11,12 of the parity: in binary, 110001110101 = 0xE3A

   Similarly, to calculate the inverse, we read across the top of the table and
   see that P1 is affected by bits MC1,MC2,MC3,MC4,MPL1,MPL4,MPL7: in binary,
   111110010010 = 0x49F.

   I've seen cunning implementations of this which only use one table. That
   technique doesn't seem to work with these numbers though.
