/** @defgroup wmem Wireshark Memory Manager
 *
 * Wmem is a memory management framework for Wireshark that makes it simple to
 * write dissectors (and other 'user-space' code) that doesn't leak memory. The
 * core module provides basic functions like malloc, realloc and free, but
 * many other functions are available (see the "Modules" list at the top of
 * the generated doxygen HTML).
 *
 * Any wmem functions which allocate memory are guaranteed to either succeed or
 * abort the program. However, they *can* still legally return NULL when the
 * amount of requested memory is zero.
 *
