/* This has turned into a very interesting excercise in algorithms and data
 * structures.
 *
 * HISTORY
 *
 * Version 1 of this allocator was embedded in the original emem framework. It
 * didn't have to handle realloc or free, so it was very simple: it just grabbed
 * a block from the OS and served allocations sequentially out of that until it
 * ran out, then allocated a new block. The old block was never revisited, so
 * it generally had a bit of wasted space at the end, but the waste was
 * small enough that it was simply ignored. This allocator provided very fast
 * constant-time allocation for any request that didn't require a new block from
 * the OS, and that cost could be amortized away.
 *
 * Version 2 of this allocator was prompted by the need to support realloc and
 * free in wmem. The original version simply didn't save enough metadata to do
 * this, so I added a layer on top to make it possible. The primary principle
 * was the same (allocate sequentially out of big blocks) with a bit of extra
 * magic. Allocations were still fast constant-time, and frees were as well.
 * Large parts of that design are still present in this one, but for more
 * details see older versions of this file from git or svn.
 *
 * Version 3 of this allocator was written to address some issues that
 * eventually showed up with version 2 under real-world usage. Specifically,
 * version 2 dealt very poorly with memory fragmentation, almost never reusing
 * freed blocks and choosing to just keep allocating from the master block
 * instead. This led to particularly poor behaviour under the tick-tock loads
 * (alloc/free/alloc/free or alloc/alloc/free/alloc/alloc/free/ or ...) that
 * showed up in a couple of different protocol dissectors (TCP, Kafka).
 *
 * BLOCKS AND CHUNKS
 *
 * As in previous versions, allocations typically happen sequentially out of
 * large OS-level blocks. Each block has a short embedded header used to
 * maintain a doubly-linked list of all blocks (used or not) currently owned by
 * the allocator. Each block is divided into chunks, which represent allocations
 * and free sections (a block is initialized with one large, free, chunk). Each
 * chunk is prefixed with a wmem_block_chunk_t structure, which is a short
 * metadata header (8 bytes, regardless of 32 or 64-bit architecture unless
 * alignment requires it to be padded) that contains the length of the chunk,
 * the length of the previous chunk, a flag marking the chunk as free or used,
 * and a flag marking the last chunk in a block. This serves to implement an
 * inline sequential doubly-linked list of all the chunks in each block. A block
 * with three chunks might look something like this:
 *
 *          0                    _________________________
 *          ^      ___________  /        ______________   \       __________
 * ||---||--|-----/-----------||--------/--------------||--\-----/----------||
 * ||hdr|| prv | len |  body  || prv | len |   body    || prv | len | body  ||
 * ||---||--------------------||--/--------------------||-------------------||
 *        \______________________/
 *
 *
 * When allocating, a free chunk is found (more on that later) and split into
 * two chunks: the first of the requested size and the second containing any
 * remaining free. The first is marked used and returned to the caller.
 *
 * When freeing, the chunk in question is marked as free. Its neighbouring
 * chunks are then checked; if either of them are free, the consecutive free
 * chunks are merged into a single larger free chunk. Induction can show that
 * applying this operation consistently prevents us ever having consecutive
 * free chunks.
 *
 * Free chunks (because they are not being used for anything else) each store an
 * additional pair of pointers (see the wmem_block_free_t structure) that form
 * the backbone of the data structures used to track free chunks.
 *
 * MASTER AND RECYCLER
 *
 * The extra pair of pointers in free chunks are used to build two doubly-linked
 * lists: the master and the recycler. The recycler is circular, the master is
 * a stack.
 *
 * The master stack is only populated by chunks from new OS-level blocks,
 * so every chunk in this list is guaranteed to be able to serve any allocation
 * request (the allocator will not serve requests larger than its block size).
 * The chunk at the head of the master list shrinks as it serves requests. When
 * it is too small to serve the current request, it is popped and inserted into
 * the recycler. If the master list is empty, a new OS-level block is allocated,
 * and its chunk is pushed onto the master stack.
 *
 * The recycler is populated by 'leftovers' from the master, as well as any
 * chunks that were returned to the allocator via a call to free(). Although the
 * recycler is circular, we will refer to the element referenced from the
 * allocator as the 'head' of the list for convenience. The primary operation on
 * the recycler is called cycling it. In this operation, the head is compared
 * with its clockwise neighbour. If the neighbour is as large or larger, it
 * becomes the head (the list rotates counter-clockwise). If the neighbour is
 * smaller, then it is removed from its location and inserted as the counter-
 * clockwise neighbour of the head (the list still rotates counter-clockwise,
 * but the head element is held fixed while the rest of the list spins). This
 * operation has the following properties:
 *  - fast constant time
 *  - once the largest chunk is at the head, it remains at the head
 *  - more iterations increases the probability that the largest chunk will be
 *    the head (for a list with n items, n iterations guarantees that the
 *    largest chunk will be the head).
 *
 * ALLOCATING
 *
 * When an allocation request is received, the allocator first attempts to
 * satisfy it with the chunk at the head of the recycler. If that does not
 * succeed, the request is satisfied by the master list instead. Regardless of
 * which chunk satisfied the request, the recycler is always cycled.
