/* One of the supposed benefits of wmem over the old emem was going to be that
 * the scoping of the various memory pools would be obvious, since they would
 * no longer be global. Instead, the pools would be managed as variables scoped
 * by the compiler, so functions outside of that scope wouldn't have access to
 * the pools and wouldn't be able to allocate memory in a scope to which they
 * didn't belong.
 *
 * That idea fell apart rather quickly :P
 *
 * The principle still stands, and most pools should be managed in that way.
 * The three in this file are *exceptions*. They are the three scopes that emem
 * provided as globals. Converting all of the code that used them to pass an
 * extra parameter (or three) around would have been a nightmare of epic
 * proportions, so we provide these three as globals still.
 *
 * We do, however, use some extra booleans and a mountain of assertions to try
 * and catch anybody accessing the pools out of the correct scope. It's not
 * perfect, but it should stop most of the bad behaviour that emem permitted.
