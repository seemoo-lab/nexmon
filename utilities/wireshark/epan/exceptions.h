/**
    Index is out of range.
    An attempt was made to read past the end of a buffer.
    This generally means that the capture was done with a "slice"
    length or "snapshot" length less than the maximum packet size,
    and a link-layer packet was cut short by that, so not all of the
    data in the link-layer packet was available.
**/
#define BoundsError		1

/**
    Index is beyond reported length (not cap_len)
    An attempt was made to read past the logical end of a buffer. This
    differs from a BoundsError in that the parent protocol established a
    limit past which this dissector should not process in the buffer and that
    limit was exceeded.
    This generally means that the packet is invalid, i.e. whatever
    code constructed the packet and put it on the wire didn't put enough
    data into it.  It is therefore currently reported as a "Malformed
    packet".

/**
    A bug was detected in a dissector.

    DO NOT throw this with THROW(); that means that no details about
    the dissector error will be reported.  (Instead, the message will
    blame you for not providing details.)

    Instead, use the DISSECTOR_ASSERT(), etc. macros in epan/proto.h.

/**
    Index is out of range.
    An attempt was made to read past the end of a buffer.
    This error is specific to SCSI data transfers where for some CDBs
    it is normal that the data PDU might be short.
    I.e. ReportLuns initially called with allocation_length=8, just enough
    to get the "size" of lun list back after which the initiator will
    reissue the command with an allocation_length that is big enough.

/**
    The reassembly state machine was passed a bad fragment offset,
    or other similar issues. We used to use DissectorError in these
    cases, but they're not necessarily the dissector's fault - if the packet
    contains a bad fragment offset, the dissector shouldn't have to figure
    that out by itself since that's what the reassembly machine is for.

/*
 * Catch errors that, if you're calling a subdissector and catching

 * sense to continue dissecting:
 *
 * BoundsError indicates a configuration problem (the capture was
 * set up to throw away data, and it did); there's no point in
 * trying to dissect any more data, as there's no more data to dissect.
 *
 * FragmentBoundsError indicates a configuration problem (reassembly
 * wasn't enabled or couldn't be done); there's no point in trying
 * to dissect any more data, as there's no more data to dissect.
 *
 * OutOfMemoryError indicates what its name suggests; there's no point
 * in trying to dissect any more data, as you're probably not going to
 * have any more memory to use when dissecting them.
 *
 * Other errors indicate that there's some sort of problem with
 * the packet; you should continue dissecting data, as it might
 * be OK, and, even if it's not, you should report its problem

/* Register cleanup functions in case an exception is thrown and not caught.
 * From the Kazlib documentation, with modifications for use with the
 * Wireshark-specific macros:
 *
 * CLEANUP_PUSH(func, arg)
 *
 *  The call to CLEANUP_PUSH shall be matched with a call to
 *  CLEANUP_CALL_AND_POP or CLEANUP_POP which must occur in the same
 *  statement block at the same level of nesting. This requirement allows
 *  an implementation to provide a CLEANUP_PUSH macro which opens up a
 *  statement block and a CLEANUP_POP which closes the statement block.
 *  The space for the registered pointers can then be efficiently
 *  allocated from automatic storage.
 *
 *  The CLEANUP_PUSH macro registers a cleanup handler that will be
 *  called if an exception subsequently occurs before the matching
 *  CLEANUP_[CALL_AND_]POP is executed, and is not intercepted and
 *  handled by a try-catch region that is nested between the two.
 *
 *  The first argument to CLEANUP_PUSH is a pointer to the cleanup
 *  handler, a function that returns nothing and takes a single
 *  argument of type void*. The second argument is a void* value that
 *  is registered along with the handler.  This value is what is passed
 *  to the registered handler, should it be called.
 *
 *  Cleanup handlers are called in the reverse order of their nesting:
 *  inner handlers are called before outer handlers.
 *
 *  The program shall not leave the cleanup region between
 *  the call to the macro CLEANUP_PUSH and the matching call to
 *  CLEANUP_[CALL_AND_]POP by means other than throwing an exception,
 *  or calling CLEANUP_[CALL_AND_]POP.
 *
 *  Within the call to the cleanup handler, it is possible that new
 *  exceptions may happen.  Such exceptions must be handled before the
 *  cleanup handler terminates. If the call to the cleanup handler is
 *  terminated by an exception, the behavior is undefined. The exception
 *  which triggered the cleanup is not yet caught; thus the program
 *  would be effectively trying to replace an exception with one that
 *  isn't in a well-defined state.
 *
 *
 * CLEANUP_POP and CLEANUP_CALL_AND_POP
 *
 *  A call to the CLEANUP_POP or CLEANUP_CALL_AND_POP macro shall match
 *  each call to CLEANUP_PUSH which shall be in the same statement block
 *  at the same nesting level.  It shall match the most recent such a
 *  call that is not matched by a previous CLEANUP_[CALL_AND_]POP at
 *  the same level.
 *
 *  These macros causes the registered cleanup handler to be removed. If
 *  CLEANUP_CALL_AND_POP is called, the cleanup handler is called.
 *  In that case, the registered context pointer is passed to the cleanup
 *  handler. If CLEANUP_POP is called, the cleanup handler is not called.
 *
 *  The program shall not leave the region between the call to the
 *  macro CLEANUP_PUSH and the matching call to CLEANUP_[CALL_AND_]POP
 *  other than by throwing an exception, or by executing the
 *  CLEANUP_CALL_AND_POP.
