/* Magic numbers in "libpcap" files.

   "libpcap" file records are written in the byte order of the host that
   writes them, and the reader is expected to fix this up.

   PCAP_MAGIC is the magic number, in host byte order; PCAP_SWAPPED_MAGIC
   is a byte-swapped version of that.

   PCAP_MODIFIED_MAGIC is for Alexey Kuznetsov's modified "libpcap"
   format, as generated on Linux systems that have a "libpcap" with
   his patches, at

	http://ftp.sunet.se/pub/os/Linux/ip-routing/lbl-tools/

   applied; PCAP_SWAPPED_MODIFIED_MAGIC is the byte-swapped version.

   PCAP_NSEC_MAGIC is for Ulf Lamping's modified "libpcap" format,
   which uses the same common file format as PCAP_MAGIC, but the
   timestamps are saved in nanosecond resolution instead of microseconds.
   PCAP_SWAPPED_NSEC_MAGIC is a byte-swapped version of that. */
