captype - Prints the types of capture files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<capinfos>
E<lt>I<infile>E<gt>
I<...>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Captypes> is a program that opens one or more capture files and
prints the capture file type of each E<lt>I<infile>E<gt>.

B<Capinfos> is able to detect and read the same capture files that are
supported by B<Wireshark>.
The input files don't need a specific filename extension; the file
format and an optional gzip compression will be automatically detected.
Near the beginning of the DESCRIPTION section of wireshark(1) or
L<https://www.wireshark.org/docs/man-pages/wireshark.html>
is a detailed description of the way B<Wireshark> handles this, which is
the same way B<Capinfos> handles this.
