# It strips the executable and libraries if '-s' is given.
# The Info.plist file can be found in the base wireshark directory once

# files to have OS X-ish paths under Contents/Resources of the bundle
# or under /Library/Application Support.  We don't have such an option;
# we just put them in "bin", "etc", "lib", and "share" directories
# under Contents/Resources, rather than in the "bin", "etc", "lib",

Create an app bundle for OS X

USAGE
	$0 [-s] [-l /path/to/libraries] -bp /path/to/wireshark/binaries -p /path/to/Info.plist

OPTIONS
	-h,--help
		Display this help message.
	-s
		Strip the libraries and executables from debugging symbols.
	-l,--libraries
		Specify the path to the libraries Wireshark depends on
		(typically /sw or /opt/local). By default it is
		/usr/local.
	-cb,--create-bundle
		Create the application bundle (Wireshark.app). This flag
		should be supplied when building using Autotools. It
		should not be specified when building using CMake.
	-bp,--binary-path
		Specify the path to the Wireshark binaries. By default it
		is /tmp/inst/bin.
	-lp,--library-path
		Specify the path to the Wireshark libraries. By default it
		is /tmp/inst/lib.
	-pp,--plugin-path
		Specify the path to the Wireshark plugins. By default it
		is /tmp/inst/lib/wireshark/plugins.
	-ep,--extcap-path
		Specify the path to the Wireshark extcap binaries. By
		default it is /tmp/inst/lib/wireshark/extcap.
	-p,--plist
		Specify the path to Info.plist. Info.plist can be found
		in the base directory of the source code once configure
		has been run.
	-sdkroot
		Specify the root of the SDK to use.

EXAMPLE
	$0 -s -l /opt/local -bp ../../Build/bin -p Info.plist -sdkroot /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.5.sdk
