/**
 * SECTION:types
 * @title: Basic Types
 * @short_description: standard GLib types, defined for ease-of-use
 *     and portability
 *
 * GLib defines a number of commonly used types, which can be divided
 * into 4 groups:
 * - New types which are not part of standard C (but are defined in
 *   various C standard library header files) - #gboolean, #gsize,
 *   #gssize, #goffset, #gintptr, #guintptr.
 * - Integer types which are guaranteed to be the same size across
 *   all platforms - #gint8, #guint8, #gint16, #guint16, #gint32,
 *   #guint32, #gint64, #guint64.
 * - Types which are easier to use than their standard C counterparts -
 *   #gpointer, #gconstpointer, #guchar, #guint, #gushort, #gulong.
 * - Types which correspond exactly to standard C types, but are
 *   included for completeness - #gchar, #gint, #gshort, #glong,
 *   #gfloat, #gdouble.
 *
 * GLib also defines macros for the limits of some of the standard
 * integer and floating point types, as well as macros for suitable
 * printf() formats for these types.

/* Type conversion {{{1 */

/**
 * SECTION:type_conversion
 * @title: Type Conversion Macros
 * @short_description: portably storing integers in pointer variables
 *
 * Many times GLib, GTK+, and other libraries allow you to pass "user
 * data" to a callback, in the form of a void pointer. From time to time
 * you want to pass an integer instead of a pointer. You could allocate
 * an integer, with something like:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   int *ip = g_new (int, 1);
 *   *ip = 42;
 * ]|
 * But this is inconvenient, and it's annoying to have to free the
 * memory at some later time.
 *
 * Pointers are always at least 32 bits in size (on all platforms GLib
 * intends to support). Thus you can store at least 32-bit integer values
 * in a pointer value. Naively, you might try this, but it's incorrect:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   gpointer p;
 *   int i;
 *   p = (void*) 42;
 *   i = (int) p;
 * ]|
 * Again, that example was not correct, don't copy it.
 * The problem is that on some systems you need to do this:
 * |[<!-- language="C" -->
 *   gpointer p;
 *   int i;
 *   p = (void*) (long) 42;
 *   i = (int) (long) p;
 * ]|
 * The GLib macros GPOINTER_TO_INT(), GINT_TO_POINTER(), etc. take care
 * to do the right thing on the every platform.
 *
 * Warning: You may not store pointers in integers. This is not
 * portable in any way, shape or form. These macros only allow storing
 * integers in pointers, and only preserve 32 bits of the integer; values
 * outside the range of a 32-bit integer will be mangled.

/* Byte order {{{1 */

/**
 * SECTION:byte_order
 * @title: Byte Order Macros
 * @short_description: a portable way to convert between different byte orders
 *
 * These macros provide a portable way to determine the host byte order
 * and to convert values between different byte orders.
 *
 * The byte order is the order in which bytes are stored to create larger
 * data types such as the #gint and #glong values.
 * The host byte order is the byte order used on the current machine.
 *
 * Some processors store the most significant bytes (i.e. the bytes that
 * hold the largest part of the value) first. These are known as big-endian
 * processors. Other processors (notably the x86 family) store the most
 * significant byte last. These are known as little-endian processors.
 *
 * Finally, to complicate matters, some other processors store the bytes in
 * a rather curious order known as PDP-endian. For a 4-byte word, the 3rd
 * most significant byte is stored first, then the 4th, then the 1st and
 * finally the 2nd.
 *
 * Obviously there is a problem when these different processors communicate
 * with each other, for example over networks or by using binary file formats.
 * This is where these macros come in. They are typically used to convert
 * values into a byte order which has been agreed on for use when
 * communicating between different processors. The Internet uses what is
 * known as 'network byte order' as the standard byte order (which is in
 * fact the big-endian byte order).
 *
 * Note that the byte order conversion macros may evaluate their arguments
 * multiple times, thus you should not use them with arguments which have
 * side-effects.
