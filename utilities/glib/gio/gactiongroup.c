/**
 * SECTION:gactiongroup
 * @title: GActionGroup
 * @short_description: A group of actions
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GAction
 *
 * #GActionGroup represents a group of actions. Actions can be used to
 * expose functionality in a structured way, either from one part of a
 * program to another, or to the outside world. Action groups are often
 * used together with a #GMenuModel that provides additional
 * representation data for displaying the actions to the user, e.g. in
 * a menu.
 *
 * The main way to interact with the actions in a GActionGroup is to
 * activate them with g_action_group_activate_action(). Activating an
 * action may require a #GVariant parameter. The required type of the
 * parameter can be inquired with g_action_group_get_action_parameter_type().
 * Actions may be disabled, see g_action_group_get_action_enabled().
 * Activating a disabled action has no effect.
 *
 * Actions may optionally have a state in the form of a #GVariant. The
 * current state of an action can be inquired with
 * g_action_group_get_action_state(). Activating a stateful action may
 * change its state, but it is also possible to set the state by calling
 * g_action_group_change_action_state().
 *
 * As typical example, consider a text editing application which has an
 * option to change the current font to 'bold'. A good way to represent
 * this would be a stateful action, with a boolean state. Activating the
 * action would toggle the state.
 *
 * Each action in the group has a unique name (which is a string).  All
 * method calls, except g_action_group_list_actions() take the name of
 * an action as an argument.
 *
 * The #GActionGroup API is meant to be the 'public' API to the action
 * group.  The calls here are exactly the interaction that 'external
 * forces' (eg: UI, incoming D-Bus messages, etc.) are supposed to have
 * with actions.  'Internal' APIs (ie: ones meant only to be accessed by
 * the action group implementation) are found on subclasses.  This is
 * why you will find - for example - g_action_group_get_action_enabled()
 * but not an equivalent set() call.
 *
 * Signals are emitted on the action group in response to state changes
 * on individual actions.
 *
 * Implementations of #GActionGroup should provide implementations for
 * the virtual functions g_action_group_list_actions() and
 * g_action_group_query_action().  The other virtual functions should
 * not be implemented - their "wrappers" are actually implemented with
 * calls to g_action_group_query_action().

 * Queries all aspects of the named action within an @action_group.
 *
 * This function acquires the information available from

 * g_action_group_get_action_parameter_type(),
 * g_action_group_get_action_state_type(),

 *
 * This provides two main benefits.
 *
 * The first is the improvement in efficiency that comes with not having
 * to perform repeated lookups of the action in order to discover
 * different things about it.  The second is that implementing
 * #GActionGroup can now be done by only overriding this one virtual
 * function.
 *
 * The interface provides a default implementation of this function that
 * calls the individual functions, as required, to fetch the
 * information.  The interface also provides default implementations of
 * those functions that call this function.  All implementations,
 * therefore, must override either this function or all of the others.
 *
 * If the action exists, %TRUE is returned and any of the requested
 * fields (as indicated by having a non-%NULL reference passed in) are
 * filled.  If the action doesn't exist, %FALSE is returned and the
 * fields may or may not have been modified.
 *
 * Returns: %TRUE if the action exists, else %FALSE
