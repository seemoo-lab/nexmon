/**
 * SECTION:gsocketclient
 * @short_description: Helper for connecting to a network service
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GSocketConnection, #GSocketListener
 *
 * #GSocketClient is a lightweight high-level utility class for connecting to
 * a network host using a connection oriented socket type.
 *
 * You create a #GSocketClient object, set any options you want, and then
 * call a sync or async connect operation, which returns a #GSocketConnection
 * subclass on success.
 *
 * The type of the #GSocketConnection object returned depends on the type of
 * the underlying socket that is in use. For instance, for a TCP/IP connection
 * it will be a #GTcpConnection.
 *
 * As #GSocketClient is a lightweight object, you don't need to cache it. You
 * can just create a new one any time you need one.
 *
 * Since: 2.22
