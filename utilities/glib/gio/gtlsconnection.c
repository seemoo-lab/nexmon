 *
 * Attempts a TLS handshake on @conn.
 *
 * On the client side, it is never necessary to call this method;
 * although the connection needs to perform a handshake after
 * connecting (or after sending a "STARTTLS"-type command) and may
 * need to rehandshake later if the server requests it,
 * #GTlsConnection will handle this for you automatically when you try
 * to send or receive data on the connection. However, you can call
 * g_tls_connection_handshake() manually if you want to know for sure
 * whether the initial handshake succeeded or failed (as opposed to
 * just immediately trying to write to @conn's output stream, in which
 * case if it fails, it may not be possible to tell if it failed
 * before or after completing the handshake).
 *
 * Likewise, on the server side, although a handshake is necessary at
 * the beginning of the communication, you do not need to call this
 * function explicitly unless you want clearer error reporting.
 * However, you may call g_tls_connection_handshake() later on to
 * renegotiate parameters (encryption methods, etc) with the client.
 *
 * #GTlsConnection::accept_certificate may be emitted during the
 * handshake.
