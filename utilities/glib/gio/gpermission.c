/**
 * SECTION:gpermission
 * @title: GPermission
 * @short_description: An object representing the permission
 *     to perform a certain action
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * A #GPermission represents the status of the caller's permission to
 * perform a certain action.
 *
 * You can query if the action is currently allowed and if it is
 * possible to acquire the permission so that the action will be allowed
 * in the future.
 *
 * There is also an API to actually acquire the permission and one to
 * release it.
 *
 * As an example, a #GPermission might represent the ability for the
 * user to write to a #GSettings object.  This #GPermission object could
 * then be used to decide if it is appropriate to show a "Click here to
 * unlock" button in a dialog and to provide the mechanism to invoke
 * when that button is clicked.

 * @error: a pointer to a %NULL #GError, or %NULL

 * Attempts to acquire the permission represented by @permission.
 *
 * The precise method by which this happens depends on the permission
 * and the underlying authentication mechanism.  A simple example is
 * that a dialog may appear asking the user to enter their password.
 *
 * You should check with g_permission_get_can_acquire() before calling
 * this function.
 *
 * If the permission is acquired then %TRUE is returned.  Otherwise,
 * %FALSE is returned and @error is set appropriately.
 *
 * This call is blocking, likely for a very long time (in the case that
