/**
 * SECTION:gmountoperation
 * @short_description: Object used for authentication and user interaction
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * #GMountOperation provides a mechanism for interacting with the user.
 * It can be used for authenticating mountable operations, such as loop
 * mounting files, hard drive partitions or server locations. It can
 * also be used to ask the user questions or show a list of applications
 * preventing unmount or eject operations from completing.
 *
 * Note that #GMountOperation is used for more than just #GMount
 * objects â€“ for example it is also used in g_drive_start() and
 * g_drive_stop().
 *
 * Users should instantiate a subclass of this that implements all the
 * various callbacks to show the required dialogs, such as
 * #GtkMountOperation. If no user interaction is desired (for example
 * when automounting filesystems at login time), usually %NULL can be
 * passed, see each method taking a #GMountOperation for details.
