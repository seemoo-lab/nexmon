 * @short_description: Interface for action containers
 *
 * The GActionMap interface is implemented by #GActionGroup
 * implementations that operate by containing a number of
 * named #GAction instances, such as #GSimpleActionGroup.
 *
 * One useful application of this interface is to map the
 * names of actions from various action groups to unique,
 * prefixed names (e.g. by prepending "app." or "win.").
 * This is the motivation for the 'Map' part of the interface
 * name.

 * Since: 2.32

 *            actions, in which case the default handler is used.  For
 *            boolean-stated actions with no parameter, this is a
 *            toggle.  For other state types (and parameter type equal
 *            to the state type) this will be a function that
 *            just calls @change_state (which you should provide).
 * @parameter_type: the type of the parameter that must be passed to the
 *                  activate function for this action, given as a single
 *                  GVariant type string (or %NULL for no parameter)
 * @state: the initial state for this action, given in
 *         [GVariant text format][gvariant-text].  The state is parsed
 *         with no extra type information, so type tags must be added to
 *         the string if they are necessary.  Stateless actions should
 *         give %NULL here.
 * @change_state: the callback to connect to the "change-state" signal
 *                of the action.  All stateful actions should provide a
 *                handler here; stateless actions should not.
 *
 * This struct defines a single action.  It is for use with
 * g_action_map_add_action_entries().
 *
 * The order of the items in the structure are intended to reflect
 * frequency of use.  It is permissible to use an incomplete initialiser
 * in order to leave some of the later values as %NULL.  All values
 * after @name are optional.  Additional optional fields may be added in
 * the future.
 *
 * See g_action_map_add_action_entries() for an example.
