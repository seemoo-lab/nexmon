/**
 * SECTION:gapplicationcommandline
 * @title: GApplicationCommandLine
 * @short_description: A command-line invocation of an application
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GApplication
 *
 * #GApplicationCommandLine represents a command-line invocation of
 * an application.  It is created by #GApplication and emitted
 * in the #GApplication::command-line signal and virtual function.
 *
 * The class contains the list of arguments that the program was invoked
 * with.  It is also possible to query if the commandline invocation was
 * local (ie: the current process is running in direct response to the
 * invocation) or remote (ie: some other process forwarded the
 * commandline to this process).
 *
 * The GApplicationCommandLine object can provide the @argc and @argv
 * parameters for use with the #GOptionContext command-line parsing API,
 * with the g_application_command_line_get_arguments() function. See
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline3.c][gapplication-example-cmdline3]
 * for an example.
 *
 * The exit status of the originally-invoked process may be set and
 * messages can be printed to stdout or stderr of that process.  The
 * lifecycle of the originally-invoked process is tied to the lifecycle
 * of this object (ie: the process exits when the last reference is
 * dropped).
 *
 * The main use for #GApplicationCommandLine (and the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal) is 'Emacs server' like use cases:
 * You can set the `EDITOR` environment variable to have e.g. git use
 * your favourite editor to edit commit messages, and if you already
 * have an instance of the editor running, the editing will happen
 * in the running instance, instead of opening a new one. An important
 * aspect of this use case is that the process that gets started by git
 * does not return until the editing is done.
 *
 * Normally, the commandline is completely handled in the
 * #GApplication::command-line handler. The launching instance exits
 * once the signal handler in the primary instance has returned, and
 * the return value of the signal handler becomes the exit status
 * of the launching instance.

 *
 * In more complicated cases, the handling of the comandline can be
 * split between the launcher and the primary instance.

 * In this example of split commandline handling, options that start
 * with `--local-` are handled locally, all other options are passed
 * to the #GApplication::command-line handler which runs in the primary
 * instance.

 * The complete example can be found here:
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-cmdline2.c)

 * be better to defer it.

 * ]|
 * In this example the commandline is not completely handled before
 * the #GApplication::command-line handler returns. Instead, we keep
 * a reference to the #GApplicationCommandLine object and handle it
 * later (in this example, in an idle). Note that it is necessary to
 * hold the application until you are done with the commandline.

/**
 * g_application_command_line_set_exit_status:
 * @cmdline: a #GApplicationCommandLine
 * @exit_status: the exit status
 *
 * Sets the exit status that will be used when the invoking process
 * exits.
 *
 * The return value of the #GApplication::command-line signal is
 * passed to this function when the handler returns.  This is the usual
 * way of setting the exit status.
 *
 * In the event that you want the remote invocation to continue running
 * and want to decide on the exit status in the future, you can use this
 * call.  For the case of a remote invocation, the remote process will
 * typically exit when the last reference is dropped on @cmdline.  The
 * exit status of the remote process will be equal to the last value
 * that was set with this function.
 *
 * In the case that the commandline invocation is local, the situation
 * is slightly more complicated.  If the commandline invocation results
 * in the mainloop running (ie: because the use-count of the application
 * increased to a non-zero value) then the application is considered to
 * have been 'successful' in a certain sense, and the exit status is
 * always zero.  If the application use count is zero, though, the exit
 * status of the local #GApplicationCommandLine is used.
