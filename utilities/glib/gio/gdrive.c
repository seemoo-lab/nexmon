/**
 * SECTION:gdrive
 * @short_description: Drive management
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * #GDrive - this represent a piece of hardware connected to the machine.
 * It's generally only created for removable hardware or hardware with
 * removable media.
 *
 * #GDrive is a container class for #GVolume objects that stem from
 * the same piece of media. As such, #GDrive abstracts a drive with
 * (or without) removable media and provides operations for querying
 * whether media is available, determining whether media change is
 * automatically detected and ejecting the media.
 *
 * If the #GDrive reports that media isn't automatically detected, one
 * can poll for media; typically one should not do this periodically
 * as a poll for media operation is potententially expensive and may
 * spin up the drive creating noise.
 *
 * #GDrive supports starting and stopping drives with authentication
 * support for the former. This can be used to support a diverse set
 * of use cases including connecting/disconnecting iSCSI devices,
 * powering down external disk enclosures and starting/stopping
 * multi-disk devices such as RAID devices. Note that the actual
 * semantics and side-effects of starting/stopping a #GDrive may vary
 * according to implementation. To choose the correct verbs in e.g. a
 * file manager, use g_drive_get_start_stop_type().
 *
 * For porting from GnomeVFS note that there is no equivalent of
 * #GDrive in that API.
