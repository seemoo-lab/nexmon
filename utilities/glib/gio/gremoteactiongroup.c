/**
 * SECTION:gremoteactiongroup
 * @title: GRemoteActionGroup
 * @short_description: A GActionGroup that interacts with other processes
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * The GRemoteActionGroup interface is implemented by #GActionGroup
 * instances that either transmit action invocations to other processes
 * or receive action invocations in the local process from other
 * processes.
 *
 * The interface has `_full` variants of the two
 * methods on #GActionGroup used to activate actions:
 * g_action_group_activate_action() and
 * g_action_group_change_action_state(). These variants allow a
 * "platform data" #GVariant to be specified: a dictionary providing
 * context for the action invocation (for example: timestamps, startup
 * notification IDs, etc).
 *
 * #GDBusActionGroup implements #GRemoteActionGroup.  This provides a
 * mechanism to send platform data for action invocations over D-Bus.
 *
 * Additionally, g_dbus_connection_export_action_group() will check if
 * the exported #GActionGroup implements #GRemoteActionGroup and use the
 * `_full` variants of the calls if available.  This
 * provides a mechanism by which to receive platform data for action
 * invocations that arrive by way of D-Bus.
 *
 * Since: 2.32
