/**

 * @short_description: File Monitor
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * Monitors a file or directory for changes.
 *
 * To obtain a #GFileMonitor for a file or directory, use
 * g_file_monitor(), g_file_monitor_file(), or
 * g_file_monitor_directory().
 *
 * To get informed about changes to the file or directory you are
 * monitoring, connect to the #GFileMonitor::changed signal. The
 * signal will be emitted in the
 * [thread-default main context][g-main-context-push-thread-default]
 * of the thread that the monitor was created in
 * (though if the global default main context is blocked, this may
 * cause notifications to be blocked even if the thread-default
 * context is still running).

   * If using %G_FILE_MONITOR_WATCH_RENAMES on a directory monitor, and
   * the information is available (and if supported by the backend),
   * @event_type may be %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_RENAMED,
   * %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_MOVED_IN or %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_MOVED_OUT.
   *
   * In all cases @file will be a child of the monitored directory.  For
   * renames, @file will be the old name and @other_file is the new
   * name.  For "moved in" events, @file is the name of the file that
   * appeared and @other_file is the old name that it was moved from (in
   * another directory).  For "moved out" events, @file is the name of
   * the file that used to be in this directory and @other_file is the
   * name of the file at its new location.

   * It makes sense to treat %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_MOVED_IN as
   * equivalent to %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_CREATED and
   * %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_MOVED_OUT as equivalent to
   * %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_DELETED, with extra information.
   * %G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_RENAMED is equivalent to a delete/create
   * pair.  This is exactly how the events will be reported in the case
   * that the %G_FILE_MONITOR_WATCH_RENAMES flag is not in use.
   *
   * If using the deprecated flag %G_FILE_MONITOR_SEND_MOVED flag and @event_type is
   * #G_FILE_MONITOR_EVENT_MOVED, @file will be set to a #GFile containing the
   * old path, and @other_file will be set to a #GFile containing the new path.
   *
   * In all the other cases, @other_file will be set to #NULL.
