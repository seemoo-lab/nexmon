/**
 * SECTION:gmount
 * @short_description: Mount management
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: GVolume, GUnixMountEntry, GUnixMountPoint
 *
 * The #GMount interface represents user-visible mounts. Note, when 
 * porting from GnomeVFS, #GMount is the moral equivalent of #GnomeVFSVolume.
 *
 * #GMount is a "mounted" filesystem that you can access. Mounted is in
 * quotes because it's not the same as a unix mount, it might be a gvfs
 * mount, but you can still access the files on it if you use GIO. Might or
 * might not be related to a volume object.
 * 
 * Unmounting a #GMount instance is an asynchronous operation. For
 * more information about asynchronous operations, see #GAsyncResult
 * and #GTask. To unmount a #GMount instance, first call
 * g_mount_unmount_with_operation() with (at least) the #GMount instance and a
 * #GAsyncReadyCallback.  The callback will be fired when the
 * operation has resolved (either with success or failure), and a
 * #GAsyncReady structure will be passed to the callback.  That
 * callback should then call g_mount_unmount_with_operation_finish() with the #GMount
 * and the #GAsyncReady data to see if the operation was completed
 * successfully.  If an @error is present when g_mount_unmount_with_operation_finish() 
 * is called, then it will be filled with any error information.

 * A mount is said to be shadowed if there exists one or more user
 * visible objects (currently #GMount objects) with a root that is
 * inside the root of @mount.
 *
 * One application of shadow mounts is when exposing a single file
 * system that is used to address several logical volumes. In this
 * situation, a #GVolumeMonitor implementation would create two
 * #GVolume objects (for example, one for the camera functionality of
 * the device and one for a SD card reader on the device) with
 * activation URIs `gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/store1/`
 * and `gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/store2/`. When the
 * underlying mount (with root
 * `gphoto2://[usb:001,002]/`) is mounted, said
 * #GVolumeMonitor implementation would create two #GMount objects
 * (each with their root matching the corresponding volume activation
 * root) that would shadow the original mount.
 *
 * The proxy monitor in GVfs 2.26 and later, automatically creates and
 * manage shadow mounts (and shadows the underlying mount) if the
 * activation root on a #GVolume is set.
