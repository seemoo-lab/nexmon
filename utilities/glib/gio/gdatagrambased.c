 * SECTION:gdatagrambased
 * @short_description: Low-level datagram communications interface
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 * @see_also: #GSocket, [<gnetworking.h>][gio-gnetworking.h]
 *
 * A #GDatagramBased is a networking interface for representing datagram-based
 * communications. It is a more or less direct mapping of the core parts of the
 * BSD socket API in a portable GObject interface. It is implemented by
 * #GSocket, which wraps the UNIX socket API on UNIX and winsock2 on Windows.
 *
 * #GDatagramBased is entirely platform independent, and is intended to be used
 * alongside higher-level networking APIs such as #GIOStream.
 *
 * It uses vectored scatter/gather I/O by default, allowing for many messages
 * to be sent or received in a single call. Where possible, implementations of
 * the interface should take advantage of vectored I/O to minimise processing
 * or system calls. For example, #GSocket uses recvmmsg() and sendmmsg() where
 * possible. Callers should take advantage of scatter/gather I/O (the use of
 * multiple buffers per message) to avoid unnecessary copying of data to
 * assemble or disassemble a message.
 *
 * Each #GDatagramBased operation has a timeout parameter which may be negative
 * for blocking behaviour, zero for non-blocking behaviour, or positive for
 * timeout behaviour. A blocking operation blocks until finished or there is an
 * error. A non-blocking operation will return immediately with a
 * %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error if it cannot make progress. A timeout operation
 * will block until the operation is complete or the timeout expires; if the
 * timeout expires it will return what progress it made, or
 * %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT if no progress was made. To know when a call would
 * successfully run you can call g_datagram_based_condition_check() or
 * g_datagram_based_condition_wait(). You can also use
 * g_datagram_based_create_source() and attach it to a #GMainContext to get
 * callbacks when I/O is possible.
 *
 * When running a non-blocking operation applications should always be able to
 * handle getting a %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK error even when some other function
 * said that I/O was possible. This can easily happen in case of a race
 * condition in the application, but it can also happen for other reasons. For
 * instance, on Windows a socket is always seen as writable until a write
 * returns %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK.
 *
 * As with #GSocket, #GDatagramBaseds can be either connection oriented or
 * connectionless. The interface does not cover connection establishment — use
 * methods on the underlying type to establish a connection before sending and
 * receiving data through the #GDatagramBased API. For connectionless socket
 * types the target/source address is specified or received in each I/O
 * operation.
 *
 * Like most other APIs in GLib, #GDatagramBased is not inherently thread safe.
 * To use a #GDatagramBased concurrently from multiple threads, you must
 * implement your own locking.
 *
 * Since: 2.48

 * @num_messages: the number of elements in @messages
 * @flags: an int containing #GSocketMsgFlags flags for the overall operation
 * @timeout: the maximum time (in microseconds) to wait, 0 to not block, or -1
 *   to block indefinitely
 * @cancellable: (allow-none): a %GCancellable
 * @error: return location for a #GError
 *
 * Receive one or more data messages from @datagram_based in one go.
 *
 * @messages must point to an array of #GInputMessage structs and
 * @num_messages must be the length of this array. Each #GInputMessage
 * contains a pointer to an array of #GInputVector structs describing the
 * buffers that the data received in each message will be written to.
 *
 * @flags modify how all messages are received. The commonly available
 * arguments for this are available in the #GSocketMsgFlags enum, but the
 * values there are the same as the system values, and the flags
 * are passed in as-is, so you can pass in system-specific flags too. These
 * flags affect the overall receive operation. Flags affecting individual
 * messages are returned in #GInputMessage.flags.
 *
 * The other members of #GInputMessage are treated as described in its
 * documentation.
 *
 * If @timeout is negative the call will block until @num_messages have been
 * received, the connection is closed remotely (EOS), @cancellable is cancelled,
 * or an error occurs.
 *
 * If @timeout is 0 the call will return up to @num_messages without blocking,
 * or %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK if no messages are queued in the operating system
 * to be received.
 *
 * If @timeout is positive the call will block on the same conditions as if
 * @timeout were negative. If the timeout is reached
 * before any messages are received, %G_IO_ERROR_TIMED_OUT is returned,
 * otherwise it will return the number of messages received before timing out.
 * (Note: This is effectively the behaviour of `MSG_WAITFORONE` with
 * recvmmsg().)
 *
 * To be notified when messages are available, wait for the %G_IO_IN condition.
 * Note though that you may still receive %G_IO_ERROR_WOULD_BLOCK from
 * g_datagram_based_receive_messages() even if you were previously notified of a
 * %G_IO_IN condition.
 *
 * If the remote peer closes the connection, any messages queued in the
 * underlying receive buffer will be returned, and subsequent calls to
 * g_datagram_based_receive_messages() will return 0 (with no error set).
 *
 * If the connection is shut down or closed (by calling g_socket_close() or
 * g_socket_shutdown() with @shutdown_read set, if it’s a #GSocket, for
 * example), all calls to this function will return %G_IO_ERROR_CLOSED.
 *
 * On error -1 is returned and @error is set accordingly. An error will only
 * be returned if zero messages could be received; otherwise the number of
 * messages successfully received before the error will be returned. If
 * @cancellable is cancelled, %G_IO_ERROR_CANCELLED is returned as with any
 * other error.
 *
 * Returns: number of messages received, or -1 on error. Note that the number
 *     of messages received may be smaller than @num_messages if @timeout is
 *     zero or positive, if the peer closed the connection, or if @num_messages
 *     was larger than `UIO_MAXIOV` (1024), in which case the caller may re-try
 *     to receive the remaining messages.
