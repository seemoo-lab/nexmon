/**
 * SECTION:gapplication
 * @title: GApplication
 * @short_description: Core application class
 * @include: gio/gio.h
 *
 * A #GApplication is the foundation of an application.  It wraps some
 * low-level platform-specific services and is intended to act as the
 * foundation for higher-level application classes such as
 * #GtkApplication or #MxApplication.  In general, you should not use
 * this class outside of a higher level framework.
 *
 * GApplication provides convenient life cycle management by maintaining
 * a "use count" for the primary application instance. The use count can
 * be changed using g_application_hold() and g_application_release(). If
 * it drops to zero, the application exits. Higher-level classes such as
 * #GtkApplication employ the use count to ensure that the application
 * stays alive as long as it has any opened windows.
 *
 * Another feature that GApplication (optionally) provides is process
 * uniqueness. Applications can make use of this functionality by
 * providing a unique application ID. If given, only one application
 * with this ID can be running at a time per session. The session
 * concept is platform-dependent, but corresponds roughly to a graphical
 * desktop login. When your application is launched again, its
 * arguments are passed through platform communication to the already
 * running program. The already running instance of the program is
 * called the "primary instance"; for non-unique applications this is
 * the always the current instance. On Linux, the D-Bus session bus
 * is used for communication.
 *
 * The use of #GApplication differs from some other commonly-used
 * uniqueness libraries (such as libunique) in important ways. The
 * application is not expected to manually register itself and check
 * if it is the primary instance. Instead, the main() function of a
 * #GApplication should do very little more than instantiating the
 * application instance, possibly connecting signal handlers, then
 * calling g_application_run(). All checks for uniqueness are done
 * internally. If the application is the primary instance then the
 * startup signal is emitted and the mainloop runs. If the application
 * is not the primary instance then a signal is sent to the primary
 * instance and g_application_run() promptly returns. See the code
 * examples below.
 *
 * If used, the expected form of an application identifier is very close
 * to that of of a
 * [DBus bus name](http://dbus.freedesktop.org/doc/dbus-specification.html#message-protocol-names-interface).
 * Examples include: "com.example.MyApp", "org.example.internal-apps.Calculator".
 * For details on valid application identifiers, see g_application_id_is_valid().
 *
 * On Linux, the application identifier is claimed as a well-known bus name
 * on the user's session bus.  This means that the uniqueness of your
 * application is scoped to the current session.  It also means that your
 * application may provide additional services (through registration of other
 * object paths) at that bus name.  The registration of these object paths
 * should be done with the shared GDBus session bus.  Note that due to the
 * internal architecture of GDBus, method calls can be dispatched at any time
 * (even if a main loop is not running).  For this reason, you must ensure that
 * any object paths that you wish to register are registered before #GApplication
 * attempts to acquire the bus name of your application (which happens in
 * g_application_register()).  Unfortunately, this means that you cannot use
 * g_application_get_is_remote() to decide if you want to register object paths.
 *
 * GApplication also implements the #GActionGroup and #GActionMap
 * interfaces and lets you easily export actions by adding them with
 * g_action_map_add_action(). When invoking an action by calling
 * g_action_group_activate_action() on the application, it is always
 * invoked in the primary instance. The actions are also exported on
 * the session bus, and GIO provides the #GDBusActionGroup wrapper to
 * conveniently access them remotely. GIO provides a #GDBusMenuModel wrapper
 * for remote access to exported #GMenuModels.
 *
 * There is a number of different entry points into a GApplication:
 *
 * - via 'Activate' (i.e. just starting the application)
 *
 * - via 'Open' (i.e. opening some files)
 *
 * - by handling a command-line
 *
 * - via activating an action
 *
 * The #GApplication::startup signal lets you handle the application
 * initialization for all of these in a single place.
 *
 * Regardless of which of these entry points is used to start the
 * application, GApplication passes some "platform data from the
 * launching instance to the primary instance, in the form of a
 * #GVariant dictionary mapping strings to variants. To use platform
 * data, override the @before_emit or @after_emit virtual functions
 * in your #GApplication subclass. When dealing with
 * #GApplicationCommandLine objects, the platform data is
 * directly available via g_application_command_line_get_cwd(),
 * g_application_command_line_get_environ() and
 * g_application_command_line_get_platform_data().
 *
 * As the name indicates, the platform data may vary depending on the
 * operating system, but it always includes the current directory (key
 * "cwd"), and optionally the environment (ie the set of environment
 * variables and their values) of the calling process (key "environ").
 * The environment is only added to the platform data if the
 * %G_APPLICATION_SEND_ENVIRONMENT flag is set. #GApplication subclasses
 * can add their own platform data by overriding the @add_platform_data
 * virtual function. For instance, #GtkApplication adds startup notification
 * data in this way.
 *
 * To parse commandline arguments you may handle the
 * #GApplication::command-line signal or override the local_command_line()
 * vfunc, to parse them in either the primary instance or the local instance,
 * respectively.
 *
 * For an example of opening files with a GApplication, see
 * [gapplication-example-open.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-open.c).
 *
 * For an example of using actions with GApplication, see
 * [gapplication-example-actions.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-actions.c).
 *
 * For an example of using extra D-Bus hooks with GApplication, see
 * [gapplication-example-dbushooks.c](https://git.gnome.org/browse/glib/tree/gio/tests/gapplication-example-dbushooks.c).

/**
 * GApplication:
 *
 * #GApplication is an opaque data structure and can only be accessed
 * using the following functions.
 * Since: 2.28
 */

/**
 * GApplicationClass:
 * @startup: invoked on the primary instance immediately after registration
 * @shutdown: invoked only on the registered primary instance immediately
 *      after the main loop terminates
 * @activate: invoked on the primary instance when an activation occurs
 * @open: invoked on the primary instance when there are files to open
 * @command_line: invoked on the primary instance when a command-line is
 *   not handled locally
 * @local_command_line: invoked (locally). The virtual function has the chance
 *     to inspect (and possibly replace) command line arguments. See
 *     g_application_run() for more information. Also see the
 *     #GApplication::handle-local-options signal, which is a simpler
 *     alternative to handling some commandline options locally
 * @before_emit: invoked on the primary instance before 'activate', 'open',
 *     'command-line' or any action invocation, gets the 'platform data' from
 *     the calling instance
 * @after_emit: invoked on the primary instance after 'activate', 'open',
 *     'command-line' or any action invocation, gets the 'platform data' from
 *     the calling instance
 * @add_platform_data: invoked (locally) to add 'platform data' to be sent to
 *     the primary instance when activating, opening or invoking actions
 * @quit_mainloop: Used to be invoked on the primary instance when the use
 *     count of the application drops to zero (and after any inactivity
 *     timeout, if requested). Not used anymore since 2.32
 * @run_mainloop: Used to be invoked on the primary instance from
 *     g_application_run() if the use-count is non-zero. Since 2.32,
 *     GApplication is iterating the main context directly and is not
 *     using @run_mainloop anymore
 * @dbus_register: invoked locally during registration, if the application is
 *     using its D-Bus backend. You can use this to export extra objects on the
 *     bus, that need to exist before the application tries to own the bus name.
 *     The function is passed the #GDBusConnection to to session bus, and the
 *     object path that #GApplication will use to export is D-Bus API.
 *     If this function returns %TRUE, registration will proceed; otherwise
 *     registration will abort. Since: 2.34
 * @dbus_unregister: invoked locally during unregistration, if the application
 *     is using its D-Bus backend. Use this to undo anything done by the
 *     @dbus_register vfunc. Since: 2.34
 * @handle_local_options: invoked locally after the parsing of the commandline
 *  options has occurred. Since: 2.40
 *
 * Virtual function table for #GApplication.
 *
 * Since: 2.28

 * g_application_add_main_option_entries:
 * @application: a #GApplication
 * @entries: (array zero-terminated=1) (element-type GOptionEntry) a
 *           %NULL-terminated list of #GOptionEntrys
 *
 * Adds main option entries to be handled by @application.
 *
 * This function is comparable to g_option_context_add_main_entries().
 *
 * After the commandline arguments are parsed, the
 * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal will be emitted.  At this
 * point, the application can inspect the values pointed to by @arg_data
 * in the given #GOptionEntrys.
 *
 * Unlike #GOptionContext, #GApplication supports giving a %NULL
 * @arg_data for a non-callback #GOptionEntry.  This results in the
 * argument in question being packed into a #GVariantDict which is also
 * passed to #GApplication::handle-local-options, where it can be
 * inspected and modified.  If %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is
 * set, then the resulting dictionary is sent to the primary instance,
 * where g_application_command_line_get_options_dict() will return it.
 * This "packing" is done according to the type of the argument --
 * booleans for normal flags, strings for strings, bytestrings for
 * filenames, etc.  The packing only occurs if the flag is given (ie: we
 * do not pack a "false" #GVariant in the case that a flag is missing).
 *
 * In general, it is recommended that all commandline arguments are
 * parsed locally.  The options dictionary should then be used to
 * transmit the result of the parsing to the primary instance, where
 * g_variant_dict_lookup() can be used.  For local options, it is
 * possible to either use @arg_data in the usual way, or to consult (and
 * potentially remove) the option from the options dictionary.
 *
 * This function is new in GLib 2.40.  Before then, the only real choice
 * was to send all of the commandline arguments (options and all) to the
 * primary instance for handling.  #GApplication ignored them completely
 * on the local side.  Calling this function "opts in" to the new
 * behaviour, and in particular, means that unrecognised options will be
 * treated as errors.  Unrecognised options have never been ignored when
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is unset.
 *
 * If #GApplication::handle-local-options needs to see the list of
 * filenames, then the use of %G_OPTION_REMAINING is recommended.  If
 * @arg_data is %NULL then %G_OPTION_REMAINING can be used as a key into
 * the options dictionary.  If you do use %G_OPTION_REMAINING then you
 * need to handle these arguments for yourself because once they are
 * consumed, they will no longer be visible to the default handling
 * (which treats them as filenames to be opened).
 *
 * It is important to use the proper GVariant format when retrieving
 * the options with g_variant_dict_lookup():
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_NONE, use b
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING, use &s
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT, use i
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_INT64, use x
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_DOUBLE, use d
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME, use ^ay
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_STRING_ARRAY, use &as
 * - for %G_OPTION_ARG_FILENAME_ARRAY, use ^aay

   * (which may be useful for options like --version).
   *

   * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE the "normal processing" will
   * send the @options dictionary to the primary instance where it can be
   * read with g_application_command_line_get_options_dict().  The signal
   * handler can modify the dictionary before returning, and the
   * modified dictionary will be sent.
   *
   * In the event that %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE is not set,
   * "normal processing" will treat the remaining uncollected command
   * line arguments as filenames or URIs.  If there are no arguments,
   * the application is activated by g_application_activate().  One or
   * more arguments results in a call to g_application_open().
   *
   * If you want to handle the local commandline arguments for yourself
   * by converting them to calls to g_application_open() or
   * g_action_group_activate_action() then you must be sure to register
   * the application first.  You should probably not call
   * g_application_activate() for yourself, however: just return -1 and
   * allow the default handler to do it for you.  This will ensure that
   * the `--gapplication-service` switch works properly (i.e. no activation
   * in that case).
   *
   * Note that this signal is emitted from the default implementation of
   * local_command_line().  If you override that function and don't
   * chain up then this signal will never be emitted.
   *
   * You can override local_command_line() if you need more powerful
   * capabilities than what is provided here, but this should not
   * normally be required.
   *
   * Returns: an exit code. If you have handled your options and want
   * to exit the process, return a non-negative option, 0 for success,
   * and a positive value for failure. To continue, return -1 to let
   * the default option processing continue.

 * @argc: the argc from main() (or 0 if @argv is %NULL)

 *
 * Runs the application.
 *
 * This function is intended to be run from main() and its return value
 * is intended to be returned by main(). Although you are expected to pass
 * the @argc, @argv parameters from main() to this function, it is possible
 * to pass %NULL if @argv is not available or commandline handling is not
 * required.  Note that on Windows, @argc and @argv are ignored, and
 * g_win32_get_command_line() is called internally (for proper support
 * of Unicode commandline arguments).
 *
 * #GApplication will attempt to parse the commandline arguments.  You
 * can add commandline flags to the list of recognised options by way of
 * g_application_add_main_option_entries().  After this, the
 * #GApplication::handle-local-options signal is emitted, from which the
 * application can inspect the values of its #GOptionEntrys.
 *
 * #GApplication::handle-local-options is a good place to handle options
 * such as `--version`, where an immediate reply from the local process is
 * desired (instead of communicating with an already-running instance).
 * A #GApplication::handle-local-options handler can stop further processing
 * by returning a non-negative value, which then becomes the exit status of
 * the process.
 *
 * What happens next depends on the flags: if
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_COMMAND_LINE was specified then the remaining
 * commandline arguments are sent to the primary instance, where a
 * #GApplication::command-line signal is emitted.  Otherwise, the
 * remaining commandline arguments are assumed to be a list of files.
 * If there are no files listed, the application is activated via the
 * #GApplication::activate signal.  If there are one or more files, and
 * %G_APPLICATION_HANDLES_OPEN was specified then the files are opened
 * via the #GApplication::open signal.
 *
 * If you are interested in doing more complicated local handling of the
 * commandline then you should implement your own #GApplication subclass
 * and override local_command_line(). In this case, you most likely want
 * to return %TRUE from your local_command_line() implementation to
 * suppress the default handling. See
 * [gapplication-example-cmdline2.c][gapplication-example-cmdline2]
 * for an example.
 *
 * If, after the above is done, the use count of the application is zero
 * then the exit status is returned immediately.  If the use count is
 * non-zero then the default main context is iterated until the use count
 * falls to zero, at which point 0 is returned.
 *
 * If the %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set, then the service will
 * run for as much as 10 seconds with a use count of zero while waiting
 * for the message that caused the activation to arrive.  After that,
 * if the use count falls to zero the application will exit immediately,
 * except in the case that g_application_set_inactivity_timeout() is in
 * use.
 *
 * This function sets the prgname (g_set_prgname()), if not already set,
 * to the basename of argv[0].
 *
 * Much like g_main_loop_run(), this function will acquire the main context
 * for the duration that the application is running.
 *
 * Since 2.40, applications that are not explicitly flagged as services
 * or launchers (ie: neither %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE or
 * %G_APPLICATION_IS_LAUNCHER are given as flags) will check (from the
 * default handler for local_command_line) if "--gapplication-service"
 * was given in the command line.  If this flag is present then normal
 * commandline processing is interrupted and the
 * %G_APPLICATION_IS_SERVICE flag is set.  This provides a "compromise"
 * solution whereby running an application directly from the commandline
 * will invoke it in the normal way (which can be useful for debugging)
 * while still allowing applications to be D-Bus activated in service
 * mode.  The D-Bus service file should invoke the executable with
 * "--gapplication-service" as the sole commandline argument.  This
 * approach is suitable for use by most graphical applications but
 * should not be used from applications like editors that need precise
 * control over when processes invoked via the commandline will exit and
 * what their exit status will be.
 *
 * Returns: the exit status
