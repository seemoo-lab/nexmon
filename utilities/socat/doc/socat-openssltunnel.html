<h1>Securing Traffic Between two Socat Instances Using SSL</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
When you want to connect two socat processes running on different machines and
feel that you need to protect the connection against unauthorized access,
sniffing, data manipulation etc., you might want to encrypt the communications.
</p>
<p>
For this purpose socat integrates the OpenSSL library and provides SSL client
and server features. 
</p>
<p>
SSL is a complex protocol that provides much more features than required for
protecting a single connection; in this document we present only a simple
scenario that provides just the basic security requirements.
</p>

<h2>Configuring OpenSSL in socat</h2>
<p>
This section shows how the SSL addresses can be configured in socat.
In this docu we only use self signed certificates for the sake of simplicity. 
</p>
<p>We assume that the server host is called <tt>server.domain.org</tt> and the
server process uses port 4433. To keep it simple, we use a very simple server
funtionality that just echos data (<tt>echo</tt>), and <tt>stdio</tt> on the
client.</p>
<h3>Generate a server certificate</h3>

<p>Perform the following steps on a trusted host where OpenSSL is
installed. It might as well be the client or server host themselves.</p>
<p>Prepare a basename for the files related to the server certificate:</p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">FILENAME=server</span></span>

<p>Generate a public/private key pair:</p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">openssl genrsa -out $FILENAME.key 1024</span></span>

<p>Generate a self signed certificate:</p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">
openssl req -new -key $FILENAME.key -x509 -days 3653 -out $FILENAME.crt</span></span>
<p>You will be prompted for your country code, name etc.; you may quit all prompts
with the enter key.</p>
<p>Generate the PEM file by just appending the key and certificate files:<p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">cat $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.crt &gt;$FILENAME.pem</span></span>

<p>The files that contain the private key should be kept secret, thus adapt
their permissions:<p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">chmod 600 $FILENAME.key $FILENAME.pem</span></span>

<p>Now bring the file <tt>server.pem</tt> to the SSL server, e.g. to directory
<tt>$HOME/etc/</tt>, using a secure channel like USB memory stick or SSH. Keep
tight permissions on the file even on the target host, and remove all other
instances of <tt>server.key</tt> and <tt>server.pem</tt>.
</p>
<p>Copy the trust certificate server.crt to the SSL client host, e.g. to directory
<tt>$HOME/etc/</tt>; a secure channel is not required here, and the permissions
are not critical.
</p>

<h3>Generate a client certificate</h3>
<p>First prepare a different basename for the files related to the client certificate:</p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">FILENAME=client</span></span>

<p>Repeat the procedure for certificate generation described above.
Copy <tt>client.pem</tt> to the SSL client, and <tt>client.crt</tt> to the
server.</p>

<h3>OpenSSL Server</h3>

<p>Instead of using a tcp-listen (tcp-l) address, we use openssl-listen (ssl-l)
for the server, <tt>cert=...</tt> tells the program to the file containing its
ceritificate and private key, and <tt>cafile=...</tt> points to the file
containing the certificate of the peer; we trust clients only if they can proof
that they have the related private key (OpenSSL handles this for us):<p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">socat openssl-listen:4433,reuseaddr,cert=$HOME/etc/server.pem,cafile=$HOME/etc/client.crt echo</span></span>
<p>After starting this command, socat should be listening on port 4433, but
will require client authentication.</p>

<h3>OpenSSL Client</h3>
<p>Substitute your <tt>tcp-connect</tt> or <tt>tcp</tt> address keyword with
<tt>openssl-connect</tt> or just <tt>ssl</tt> and here too add the
<tt>cert</tt> and <tt>cafile</tt> options:<p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">socat stdio openssl-connect:server.domain.org:4433,cert=$HOME/etc/client.pem,cafile=$HOME/etc/server.crt</span></span>
<p>This command should establish a secured connection to the server
process.</p>

<h3>TCP/IP version 6</h3>

<p>If the communication is to go over IPv6, the above described commands have
to be adapted; <tt>ip6name.domain.org</tt> is assumed to resolve to the IPv6
address of the server:</p>
<p>Server:</p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">socat
openssl-listen:4433,<b style="color:yellow">pf=ip6</b>,reuseaddr,cert=$HOME/etc/server.pem,cafile=$HOME/etc/client.crt echo</span></span>

<p>Client:</p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">socat stdio openssl-connect:<b style="color:yellow">ip6name</b>.domain.org:4433,cert=$HOME/etc/client.pem,cafile=$HOME/etc/server.crt</span></span>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<h3>Test OpenSSL Integration</h3>
<p>
If you get error messages like this:</p>
<table border="1" bgcolor="#e08080"><tr><td><tt>... E unknown device/address "openssl-listen"</tt></td></tr></table>
<p>your socat executable probably does not have the OpenSSL library linked in. 
Check socat's compile time configuration with the following command:</p>
<span class="frame"><span class="shell">socat -V |grep SSL</span></span>
<p>Positive output: 
<tt>#define WITH_OPENSSL 1</tt><br>
Negative output: 
<tt>#undef WITH_OPENSSL</tt><br>
</p>
<p>
In the latter case, make sure you have OpenSSL and its development package
(include files) installed, and check the run of the configure script.
</p>


<h2>History</h2>
<p>
A first OpenSSL client was implemented in socat 1.2.0; it did not support
client certificates and could not verify server certificates. It was rather
considered as a tool for probing typical SSL secured Internet services.
</p>
<p>
From version 1.4.0 on, socat provided experimental support for SSL client and
SSL server, implemented using the OpenSSL libraries. Only TCP/IPv4 transport
was supported. With both SSL client and server, trust certificates for checking
the peers authentication, and certificates for authentication could be
specified. This allowed for non interactive secure connection establishing.
The features were considered experimental; like most Internet sites, socat
server did not require the client to present a certificate per default, but the
client required a server certificate.

</p>
<p>
DSA certificate support is implemented since version 1.4.2.
</p>
<p>
Socat version 1.5.0 extended SSL to TCP/IPv6 transports.
</p>
<p>
With socat version 1.6.0, the SSL server per default requires the client to
present a trusted certificate. socat's OpenSSL implementation still does not
check the contents of a certificate like host name or host address.
