<h1>Executing programs using socat</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>From its very beginning socat provided the <tt>EXEC</tt> and <tt>SYSTEM</tt>
  address types for executing programs or scripts and exchanging data with
  them. Beginning with version 2 - with implementation of the address chain 
  feature (inter addresses) - these address types were enhanced to allow
  execution of programs also in inter address context.
</p>

<h2>Program context types</h2>

<p>Currently socat provides three contexts (interfaces) for program or script
  execution:
  <ul>
    <li>The <em>endpoint</em> context: this is the classical situation where
    socat equips the program with stdin and stdout. It does not
    matter if the program uses other external communication channels. Address
    keywords: EXEC, SYSTEM. This variant should be easy to understand in terms
    of socat version 1 functionality and is therefore not further
    discussed here.</li>
    <li>The <em>bidirectional inter address</em> context: socat expects the
    program to use two bidirectional channels: stdin and stdout on its "left"
    side and file descriptors 3 and 4 on its "right" side. This allows to
    provide nearly arbitrary data manipulations within the context of socat
    chains. Address keywords: EXEC, SYSTEM.</li>
    <li>The <em>unidirectional inter address</em> context: for easy
    integration of standard UNIX programs socat provides the EXEC1 and SYSTEM1
    address types where socat provides stdin on the "left" side and stdout on
    the "right" side of the program, or vice versa for right-to-left
    transfers.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>Note: The <em>endpoint</em> and the <em>unidirectional inter address</em>
  contexts both just use the program's stdio to communicate with it. However,
  in practice the last form will in most cases just manipulate and transfer
  data, while the first form will usually have side effects by communicating
  with exteral resources or by writing to the file system etc.
</p>

<h2>Executing programs in bidirectional inter address context</h2>
<p>socat address chains concatenate internal modules that communicate
  bidirectionally. 
  For example, a chain that establishes encrypted connection to a socks server
  might look something like this (parameters and options dropped):
</p>
<p><code>"SOCKS:... | OPENSSL-CLIENT | TCP:..."</code></p>
<p>If you have a program that implements a new encryption protocol the chain
  could be changed to:
</p>
<p><code>"SOCKS:... | EXEC:myencrypt.sh | TCP:..."</code></p>
<p>The complete example:</p>
<p><code>socat - "SOCKS:www.domain.com:80 | EXEC:myencrypt.sh | TCP:encrypt.secure.org:444"</code></p>

<p>The <tt>myencrypt.sh</tt> script would be a wrapper around some myencrypt
  program. It must adhere a few rules: It reads and writes cleartext data on
  its left side (FDs 0 and 1), and it reads and writes encrypted data on its
  right side (FDs 3 and 4). Thus, cleartext data would come from the left on FD
  0, be encrypted, and sent to the right side through FD 4. Encrypted data would
  come from the the right on FD 3, be unencrypted, and sent to the left side
  through FD 1. It does not matter if the encryption protocol would required
  negotiations or multiple packets on the right side.
</p>
<p>The <tt>myencrypt.sh</tt> script might log to syslog, its own log
  file, or to stderr - this is independend of socat. It might have almost
  arbitrary side effects.
</p>
<p>For optimal integration the script should be able to perform half-close and
  should be able work with different file descriptor types (sockets, pipes,
  ptys).
</p>
<p>The socat source distribution contains two example scripts that focus on
  partial aspects:
<ul>
  <li><tt>predialog.sh</tt> implements an initial dialog on the "right" script
    side and, after successful completion, begins to transfer data unmodified in
    both directions.</li>
  <li><tt>cat2.sh</tt> shows how to use two programs unidirectionally to gain
    bidirectional transfer. The important aspects here are the shell based
    input / output redirections that are necessary for half-close.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Using unidirectional inter addresses</h2>
<p>There exist lots of UNIX programs that perform data manipulation like
  compression or encoding from stdin to stdout, while related programs perform
  the  reverse operation (decompression, decoding...) also from stdin to
  stdout. socat makes it easy to use those programs directly, i.e. without the
  need to write a bidirectional wrapper shell script.
</p>
<p><code>socat - "exec1:gzip % exec1:gunzip | tcp:remotehost:port"</code>
</p>
<p>The % character creates a dual communication context where different
  inter addresses are used for left-to-right and right-to-left transer (see
  <a href="socat-addresschain.html">socat-addresschain.html#dual</a>. socat
  generates stdin/stdout file descriptors for both programs independently.
