This example relies on YaST2 (SuSE Linux: package yast2-core).

Before "make install", you need to make the locale directory writable:
  chmod a+w /usr/share/YaST2/locale
  chmod a+w /usr/share/YaST2/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES
Unfortunately this directory is hardwired in YaST; there is no way to
put the message catalogs elsewhere.

Installation:
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure --prefix=/some/prefix
  make
  make install
Cleanup:
  make distclean
  ./autoclean.sh
