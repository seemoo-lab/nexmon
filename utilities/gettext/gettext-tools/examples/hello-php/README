The gettext/PHP binding has a limitation: While it works fine for standalone
PHP programs, it cannot be used inside a web server, to translate parts of web
pages into the preferred encoding of user that makes a HTTP connection. The
reason is that a web server usually is multithreaded, and the gettext() API
relies on the process' global locale.
