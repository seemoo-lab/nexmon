/* There are two approaches for detecting a write error on a stream opened
   for writing:

     (a) Test the return value of every fwrite() or fprintf() call, and react
         immediately.
     (b) Just before fclose(), test the error indicator in the stream and
         the return value of the final fclose() call.

   The benefit of (a) is that non file related errors (such that ENOMEM during
   fprintf) and temporary error conditions can be diagnosed accurately.

   A theoretical benefit of (a) is also that, on POSIX systems, in the case of
   an ENOSPC error, errno is set and can be used by error() to provide a more
   accurate error message. But in practice, this benefit is not big because
   users can easily figure out by themselves why a file cannot be written to,
   and furthermore the function fwriteerror() can provide errno as well.

   The big drawback of (a) is extensive error checking code: Every function
   which does stream output must return an error indicator.

   This file provides support for (b).  */

   Return -1 and set errno if there was an error.  The errno value will be 0
