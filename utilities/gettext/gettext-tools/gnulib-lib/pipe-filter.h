/* Piping data through a subprocess in the na√Øve way - write data to the
   subprocess and read from the subprocess when you expect it to have
   produced results - is subject to two kinds of deadlocks:
   1) If you write more than PIPE_MAX bytes or, more generally, if you write
      more bytes than the subprocess can handle at once, the subprocess
      may write its data and wait on you to read it, but you are currently
      busy writing.
   2) When you don't know ahead of time how many bytes the subprocess
      will produce, the usual technique of calling read (fd, buf, BUFSIZ)
      with a fixed BUFSIZ will, on Linux 2.2.17 and on BSD systems, cause
      the read() call to block until *all* of the buffer has been filled.
      But the subprocess cannot produce more data until you gave it more
      input.  But you are currently busy reading from it.

   This header file declares four set of functions that pipes data through
   the subprocess, without risking these deadlocks.

   The side that writes data to the subprocess can be seen as a "generator",
   that is, as a subroutine that produces and writes a piece of data here and
   there, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_science)>.
   But often, it can be written in the form of an "iterator", that is, as a
   function that, each time it is invoked, produces and writes one more piece
   of data.

   Similarly, the side that reads data from the subprocess can be seen as
   a "generator", that is, as a subroutine that consumes a piece of data here
   and there.  Often, it can be written in the form of an "iterator", that
   is, as a function that, each time it is invoked, consumes one more piece
   of data.

   This header file declares four set of functions:

                       |   writer   |   reader   |
       ----------------+------------+------------+
       pipe_filter_ii  |  iterator  |  iterator  |
       pipe_filter_ig  |  iterator  |  generator |
       pipe_filter_gi  |  generator |  iterator  |
       pipe_filter_gg  |  generator |  generator |
       ----------------+------------+------------+

   The last one uses threads in order to implement two generators running at
   the same time.  (For the relation between generators, coroutines, and
   threads, see <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generator_(computer_science)>
   and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine>.)  It is therefore only
   portable to platforms with kernel-based POSIX threads.  */

/* These two functions together describe the side that writes data to the
   subprocess when it has the form of an iterator.
   - prepare_write (&num_bytes, p) must either return a pointer to data that
     is ready to be written and set num_bytes to the number of bytes ready to
     be written, or return NULL when no more bytes are to be written.
   - done_write (data_written, num_bytes_written) is called after
     num_bytes_written bytes were written.  It is guaranteed that
     num_bytes_written > 0.
   Here p is always the private_data argument passed to the main function.  */

                                          void *private_data);
typedef void (*done_write_fn) (void *data_written, size_t num_bytes_written,
                               void *private_data);

/* These two functions together describe the side that reads data from the

   - prepare_read (&num_bytes, p) must return a pointer to a buffer for data
     that can be read and set num_bytes to the size of that buffer
     (must be > 0).
   - done_read (data_read, num_bytes_read, p) is called after num_bytes_read
     bytes were read into the buffer.

/* Create a subprocess and pipe some data through it.
   Arguments:
   - progname is the program name used in error messages.
   - prog_path is the file name of the program to invoke.
   - prog_argv is a NULL terminated argument list, starting with prog_path as
     first element.
   - If null_stderr is true, the subprocess' stderr will be redirected to
     /dev/null, and the usual error message to stderr will be omitted.
     This is suitable when the subprocess does not fulfill an important task.
   - If exit_on_error is true, any error will cause the main process to exit
     with an error status.
   If the subprocess does not terminate correctly, exit if exit_on_error is
   true, otherwise return 127.
   Callback arguments are as described above.

   Data is alternately written to the subprocess, through the functions
   prepare_write and done_write, and read from the subprocess, through the
   functions prepare_read and done_read.

   Note that the prepare_write/done_write functions and the
   prepare_read/done_read functions may be called in different threads than
   the current thread (depending on the platform).  But they will not be
   called after the pipe_filter_ii_execute function has returned.

   - the positive exit code of the subprocess if that failed.  */
