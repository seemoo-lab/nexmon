/* Execute a Java class.
   class_name is the Java class name to be executed.
   classpaths is a list of pathnames to be prepended to the CLASSPATH.
   use_minimal_classpath = true means to ignore the user's CLASSPATH and
   use a minimal one. This is likely to reduce possible problems if the
   user's CLASSPATH contains garbage or a classes.zip file of the wrong
   Java version.
   exe_dir is a directory that may contain a native executable for the class.
   args is a NULL terminated list of arguments to be passed to the program.
   If verbose, the command to be executed will be printed.
   Then the command is passed to the execute function together with the
   private_data argument.  This function returns false if OK, true on error.
   Return false if OK, true on error.
   If quiet, error messages will not be printed.  */
