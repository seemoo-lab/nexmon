/* INTRODUCTION

   What do

      Torbjörn Granlund    (coreutils)
      François Pinard      (coreutils)
      Danilo Šegan         (gettext)

   have in common?

   A non-ASCII name. This causes trouble in the --version output. The simple
   "solution" unfortunately mutilates the name.

     $ ptx --version | grep Pinard
     Écrit par F. Pinard.

   What is desirable, is to print the full name if the output character set
   allows it, and the ASCIIfied name only as a fallback.

     $ LC_ALL=C recode-sr-latin --version

   The 'propername' module does exactly this. Plus, for languages that use
   a different writing system than the Latin alphabet, it allows a translator
   to write the name using that different writing system. In that case the
   output will look like this:
      <translated name> (<original name in English>)

   To use the 'propername' module requires three simple steps:

     1) Add it to the list of gnulib modules to import,

     2) Change the arguments of version_etc(),

          from "Paul Eggert"
          to   proper_name ("Paul Eggert")

          from "Torbjorn Granlund"
          to   proper_name_utf8 ("Torbjorn Granlund", "Torbj\303\266rn Granlund")

          from "F. Pinard"
          to   proper_name_utf8 ("Franc,ois Pinard", "Fran\303\247ois Pinard")

        (Optionally, here you can also add / * TRANSLATORS: ... * / comments
        explaining how the name is written or pronounced.)

     3) If you are using GNU gettext version 0.16.1 or older, in po/Makevars,
        in the definition of the XGETTEXT_OPTIONS variable, add:

           --keyword='proper_name:1,"This is a proper name. See the gettext manual, section Names."'
           --keyword='proper_name_utf8:1,"This is a proper name. See the gettext manual, section Names."'

        This specifies automatic comments for the translator. (Requires
        xgettext >= 0.15. The double-quotes inside the quoted string are on
        purpose: they are part of the --keyword argument syntax.)
