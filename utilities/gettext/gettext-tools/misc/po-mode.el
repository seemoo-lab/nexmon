;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the tools meant to help editing PO files,
;; as documented in the GNU gettext user's manual.  See this manual
;; for user documentation, which is not repeated here.

;; To install, merely put this file somewhere GNU Emacs will find it,
;; then add the following lines to your .emacs file:
;;
;;   (autoload 'po-mode "po-mode"
;;             "Major mode for translators to edit PO files" t)
;;   (setq auto-mode-alist (cons '("\\.po\\'\\|\\.po\\." . po-mode)
;;                               auto-mode-alist))
;;
;; To use the right coding system automatically under Emacs 20 or newer,
;; also add:
;;
;;   (autoload 'po-find-file-coding-system "po-compat")
;;   (modify-coding-system-alist 'file "\\.po\\'\\|\\.po\\."
;;                               'po-find-file-coding-system)
;;
;; You may also adjust some variables, below, by defining them in your
;; '.emacs' file, either directly or through command 'M-x customize'.

;; TODO:
;; Plural form editing:
;;  - When in edit mode, currently it highlights (in green) the msgid;
;;    it should also highlight the msgid_plural string, I would say, since
;;    the translator has to look at both.
;;  - After the translator finished the translation of msgstr[0], it would
;;    be nice if the cursor would automatically move to the beginning of the
;;    msgstr[1] line, so that the translator just needs to press RET to edit
;;    that.
;;  - If msgstr[1] is empty but msgstr[0] is not, it would be ergonomic if the
;;    contents of msgstr[0] would be copied. (Not sure if this should happen
;;    at the end of the editing msgstr[0] or at the beginning of the editing
;;    of msgstr[1].) Reason: These two strings are usually very similar.

;;; Code:

(defconst po-mode-version-string "2.24" "\
Version number of this version of po-mode.el.")

;;; Emacs portability matters - part I.
;;; Here is the minimum for customization to work.  See part II.
