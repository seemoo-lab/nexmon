	Run the install.py script as root.

b43-fwdump is an utility for dumping the current status of the device firmware
on a running device. It has some auto-detection mechanisms. So if you have
only one card in the machine, it will dump the firmware state of that card, if
called without any parameters.
Use the --shm option, if you want a Shared Memory dump.
Use the --binary option, if you want b43-fwdump to automatically dump the
disassembled code at the current PC. This is convenient for debugging
firmware crashes.

Note that b43-fwdump _must_ be run as root, as it needs direct access to the
hardware through debugfs.
Debugfs must be mounted and you must have a recent driver with support for raw
hardware access through debugfs.
If you get error messages about missing debugfs files, make sure to upgrade to
the latest development snapshot of the b43 driver.

*******************************************************************************

b43-beautifier is a tool to replace constant expressions in raw disassembled
firmware code with human-readable #defined names.

The tool requires either the disassembled source code or a binary (which it
will disassemble then) to start with. See the --asmfile and --binfile
parameters.
It also requires a path to the directory containing the hardware definitions.
This is the "common" subdirectory found in the b43-ucode GIT repository.
See the --defs parameter.




Please be careful when using these tools. Some of them have direct access to
the hardware, so you can easily crash something.
