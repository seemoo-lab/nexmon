<h3 class="section">15.7 Number of iterations analysis</h3>

<p><a name="index-Number-of-iterations-analysis-3238"></a>
Both on GIMPLE and on RTL, there are functions available to determine
the number of iterations of a loop, with a similar interface.  The
number of iterations of a loop in GCC is defined as the number of
executions of the loop latch.  In many cases, it is not possible to
determine the number of iterations unconditionally &ndash; the determined
number is correct only if some assumptions are satisfied.  The analysis
tries to verify these conditions using the information contained in the
program; if it fails, the conditions are returned together with the
result.  The following information and conditions are provided by the
analysis:

     <ul>
<li><code>assumptions</code>: If this condition is false, the rest of
the information is invalid. 
<li><code>noloop_assumptions</code> on RTL, <code>may_be_zero</code> on GIMPLE: If
this condition is true, the loop exits in the first iteration. 
<li><code>infinite</code>: If this condition is true, the loop is infinite. 
This condition is only available on RTL.  On GIMPLE, conditions for
finiteness of the loop are included in <code>assumptions</code>. 
<li><code>niter_expr</code> on RTL, <code>niter</code> on GIMPLE: The expression
that gives number of iterations.  The number of iterations is defined as
the number of executions of the loop latch. 
</ul>

 <p>Both on GIMPLE and on RTL, it necessary for the induction variable
analysis framework to be initialized (SCEV on GIMPLE, loop-iv on RTL). 
On GIMPLE, the results are stored to <code>struct tree_niter_desc</code>
structure.  Number of iterations before the loop is exited through a
given exit can be determined using <code>number_of_iterations_exit</code>
function.  On RTL, the results are returned in <code>struct niter_desc</code>
structure.  The corresponding function is named
<code>check_simple_exit</code>.  There are also functions that pass through
all the exits of a loop and try to find one with easy to determine
number of iterations &ndash; <code>find_loop_niter</code> on GIMPLE and
<code>find_simple_exit</code> on RTL.  Finally, there are functions that
provide the same information, but additionally cache it, so that
repeated calls to number of iterations are not so costly &ndash;
<code>number_of_latch_executions</code> on GIMPLE and <code>get_simple_loop_desc</code>
on RTL.

 <p>Note that some of these functions may behave slightly differently than
others &ndash; some of them return only the expression for the number of
iterations, and fail if there are some assumptions.  The function
<code>number_of_latch_executions</code> works only for single-exit loops. 
The function <code>number_of_cond_exit_executions</code> can be used to
determine number of executions of the exit condition of a single-exit
loop (i.e., the <code>number_of_latch_executions</code> increased by one).
