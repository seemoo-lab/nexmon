<h4 class="subsection">5.1.3 Setting Catchpoints</h4>

<p><a name="index-catchpoints_002c-setting-265"></a><a name="index-exception-handlers-266"></a><a name="index-event-handling-267"></a>
You can use <dfn>catchpoints</dfn> to cause the debugger to stop for certain
kinds of program events, such as C<tt>++</tt> exceptions or the loading of a
shared library.  Use the <code>catch</code> command to set a catchpoint.

     
<a name="index-catch-268"></a>
<dl><dt><code>catch </code><var>event</var><dd>Stop when <var>event</var> occurs.  The <var>event</var> can be any of the following:

          <dl>
<dt><code>throw </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>regexp</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>rethrow </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>regexp</var><span class="roman">]</span><dt><code>catch </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>regexp</var><span class="roman">]</span><dd><a name="index-catch-throw-269"></a><a name="index-catch-rethrow-270"></a><a name="index-catch-catch-271"></a><a name="index-stop-on-C_0040t_007b_002b_002b_007d-exceptions-272"></a>The throwing, re-throwing, or catching of a C<tt>++</tt> exception.

          <p>If <var>regexp</var> is given, then only exceptions whose type matches the
regular expression will be caught.

          <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fexception_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-273"></a>The convenience variable <code>$_exception</code> is available at an
exception-related catchpoint, on some systems.  This holds the
exception being thrown.

          <p>There are currently some limitations to C<tt>++</tt> exception handling in
<span class="sc">gdb</span>:

               <ul>
<li>The support for these commands is system-dependent.  Currently, only
systems using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">gnu-v3</span></samp>&rsquo; C<tt>++</tt> ABI (see <a href="ABI.html#ABI">ABI</a>) are
supported.

               <li>The regular expression feature and the <code>$_exception</code> convenience
variable rely on the presence of some SDT probes in <code>libstdc++</code>. 
If these probes are not present, then these features cannot be used. 
These probes were first available in the GCC 4.8 release, but whether
or not they are available in your GCC also depends on how it was
built.

               <li>The <code>$_exception</code> convenience variable is only valid at the
instruction at which an exception-related catchpoint is set.

               <li>When an exception-related catchpoint is hit, <span class="sc">gdb</span> stops at a
location in the system library which implements runtime exception
support for C<tt>++</tt>, usually <code>libstdc++</code>.  You can use <code>up</code>
(see <a href="Selection.html#Selection">Selection</a>) to get to your code.

               <li>If you call a function interactively, <span class="sc">gdb</span> normally returns
control to you when the function has finished executing.  If the call
raises an exception, however, the call may bypass the mechanism that
returns control to you and cause your program either to abort or to
simply continue running until it hits a breakpoint, catches a signal
that <span class="sc">gdb</span> is listening for, or exits.  This is the case even if
you set a catchpoint for the exception; catchpoints on exceptions are
disabled within interactive calls.  See <a href="Calling.html#Calling">Calling</a>, for information on
controlling this with <code>set unwind-on-terminating-exception</code>.

               <li>You cannot raise an exception interactively.

               <li>You cannot install an exception handler interactively. 
</ul>

          <br><dt><code>exception</code><dd><a name="index-catch-exception-274"></a><a name="index-Ada-exception-catching-275"></a><a name="index-catch-Ada-exceptions-276"></a>An Ada exception being raised.  If an exception name is specified
at the end of the command (eg <code>catch exception Program_Error</code>),
the debugger will stop only when this specific exception is raised. 
Otherwise, the debugger stops execution when any Ada exception is raised.

          <p>When inserting an exception catchpoint on a user-defined exception whose
name is identical to one of the exceptions defined by the language, the
fully qualified name must be used as the exception name.  Otherwise,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will assume that it should stop on the pre-defined exception
rather than the user-defined one.  For instance, assuming an exception
called <code>Constraint_Error</code> is defined in package <code>Pck</code>, then
the command to use to catch such exceptions is <kbd>catch exception
Pck.Constraint_Error</kbd>.

          <br><dt><code>exception unhandled</code><dd><a name="index-catch-exception-unhandled-277"></a>An exception that was raised but is not handled by the program.

          <br><dt><code>assert</code><dd><a name="index-catch-assert-278"></a>A failed Ada assertion.

          <br><dt><code>exec</code><dd><a name="index-catch-exec-279"></a><a name="index-break-on-fork_002fexec-280"></a>A call to <code>exec</code>.  This is currently only available for HP-UX
and <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux.

          <br><dt><code>syscall</code><dt><code>syscall </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>name</var> <span class="roman">|</span> <var>number</var><span class="roman">]</span><code> ...</code><dd><a name="index-catch-syscall-281"></a><a name="index-break-on-a-system-call_002e-282"></a>A call to or return from a system call, a.k.a. <dfn>syscall</dfn>.  A
syscall is a mechanism for application programs to request a service
from the operating system (OS) or one of the OS system services. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> can catch some or all of the syscalls issued by the
debuggee, and show the related information for each syscall.  If no
argument is specified, calls to and returns from all system calls
will be caught.

          <p><var>name</var> can be any system call name that is valid for the
underlying OS.  Just what syscalls are valid depends on the OS.  On
GNU and Unix systems, you can find the full list of valid syscall
names on <samp><span class="file">/usr/include/asm/unistd.h</span></samp>.

          <!-- For MS-Windows, the syscall names and the corresponding numbers -->
          <!-- can be found, e.g., on this URL: -->
          <!-- http://www.metasploit.com/users/opcode/syscalls.html -->
          <!-- but we don't support Windows syscalls yet. -->
          <p>Normally, <span class="sc">gdb</span> knows in advance which syscalls are valid for
each OS, so you can use the <span class="sc">gdb</span> command-line completion
facilities (see <a href="Completion.html#Completion">command completion</a>) to list the
available choices.

          <p>You may also specify the system call numerically.  A syscall's
number is the value passed to the OS's syscall dispatcher to
identify the requested service.  When you specify the syscall by its
name, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses its database of syscalls to convert the name
into the corresponding numeric code, but using the number directly
may be useful if <span class="sc">gdb</span>'s database does not have the complete
list of syscalls on your system (e.g., because <span class="sc">gdb</span> lags
behind the OS upgrades).

          <p>The example below illustrates how this command works if you don't provide
arguments to it:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall
               
               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'close'), \
               	   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.
               
               Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'close'), \
               	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>Here is an example of catching a system call by name:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall chroot
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall 'chroot' [61])
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall
               
               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'chroot'), \
               		   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.
               
               Catchpoint 1 (returned from syscall 'chroot'), \
               	0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>An example of specifying a system call numerically.  In the case
below, the syscall number has a corresponding entry in the XML
file, so <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds its name and prints it:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall 252
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 'exit_group')
               (gdb) r
               Starting program: /tmp/catch-syscall
               
               Catchpoint 1 (call to syscall 'exit_group'), \
               		   0xffffe424 in __kernel_vsyscall ()
               (gdb) c
               Continuing.
               
               Program exited normally.
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>However, there can be situations when there is no corresponding name
in XML file for that syscall number.  In this case, <span class="sc">gdb</span> prints
a warning message saying that it was not able to find the syscall name,
but the catchpoint will be set anyway.  See the example below:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall 764
               warning: The number '764' does not represent a known syscall.
               Catchpoint 2 (syscall 764)
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>If you configure <span class="sc">gdb</span> using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">--without-expat</span></samp>&rsquo; option,
it will not be able to display syscall names.  Also, if your
architecture does not have an XML file describing its system calls,
you will not be able to see the syscall names.  It is important to
notice that these two features are used for accessing the syscall
name database.  In either case, you will see a warning like this:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall
               warning: Could not open "syscalls/i386-linux.xml"
               warning: Could not load the syscall XML file 'syscalls/i386-linux.xml'.
               GDB will not be able to display syscall names.
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall)
               (gdb)
</pre>
          <p>Of course, the file name will change depending on your architecture and system.

          <p>Still using the example above, you can also try to catch a syscall by its
number.  In this case, you would see something like:

          <pre class="smallexample">               (gdb) catch syscall 252
               Catchpoint 1 (syscall(s) 252)
</pre>
          <p>Again, in this case <span class="sc">gdb</span> would not be able to display syscall's names.

          <p>With the argument &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>&rsquo;, all signals, including those used by
<span class="sc">gdb</span>, will be caught.  This argument cannot be used with other
signal names.

          <p>Otherwise, the arguments are a list of signal names as given to
<code>handle</code> (see <a href="Signals.html#Signals">Signals</a>).  Only signals specified in this list
will be caught.

          <p>One reason that <code>catch signal</code> can be more useful than
<code>handle</code> is that you can attach commands and conditions to the
catchpoint.

          <p>When a signal is caught by a catchpoint, the signal's <code>stop</code> and
<code>print</code> settings, as specified by <code>handle</code>, are ignored. 
However, whether the signal is still delivered to the inferior depends
on the <code>pass</code> setting; this can be changed in the catchpoint's
commands.
