<h3 class="section">13.4 Using Trace Files</h3>

<p><a name="index-trace-files-894"></a>
In some situations, the target running a trace experiment may no
longer be available; perhaps it crashed, or the hardware was needed
for a different activity.  To handle these cases, you can arrange to
dump the trace data into a file, and later use that file as a source
of trace data, via the <code>target tfile</code> command.

     
<a name="index-tsave-895"></a>
<dl><dt><code>tsave [ -r ] </code><var>filename</var><dt><code>tsave [-ctf] </code><var>dirname</var><dd>Save the trace data to <var>filename</var>.  By default, this command
assumes that <var>filename</var> refers to the host filesystem, so if
necessary <span class="sc">gdb</span> will copy raw trace data up from the target and
then save it.  If the target supports it, you can also supply the
optional argument <code>-r</code> (&ldquo;remote&rdquo;) to direct the target to save
the data directly into <var>filename</var> in its own filesystem, which may be
more efficient if the trace buffer is very large.  (Note, however, that
<code>target tfile</code> can only read from files accessible to the host.) 
By default, this command will save trace frame in tfile format. 
You can supply the optional argument <code>-ctf</code> to save date in CTF
format.  The <dfn>Common Trace Format</dfn> (CTF) is proposed as a trace format
that can be shared by multiple debugging and tracing tools.  Please go to
&lt;<code>http://www.efficios.com/ctf</code>&gt; to get more information.

a source of trace data.  Commands that examine data work as they do with
a live target, but it is not possible to run any new trace experiments. 
<code>tstatus</code> will report the state of the trace run at the moment
the data was saved, as well as the current trace frame you are examining. 
Both <var>filename</var> and <var>dirname</var> must be on a filesystem accessible to
the host.
