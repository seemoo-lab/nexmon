       reloc_howto_type *howto;
     
     }
     arelent;
     
</pre>
   <p><strong>Description</strong><br>
Here is a description of each of the fields within an <code>arelent</code>:

     <ul>
<li><code>sym_ptr_ptr</code>
</ul>
   The symbol table pointer points to a pointer to the symbol
associated with the relocation request.  It is the pointer
into the table returned by the back end's
<code>canonicalize_symtab</code> action. See <a href="Symbols.html#Symbols">Symbols</a>. The symbol is
referenced through a pointer to a pointer so that tools like
the linker can fix up all the symbols of the same name by
modifying only one pointer. The relocation routine looks in
the symbol and uses the base of the section the symbol is
attached to and the value of the symbol as the initial
relocation offset. If the symbol pointer is zero, then the
section provided is looked up.

     <ul>
<li><code>address</code>
</ul>
   The <code>address</code> field gives the offset in bytes from the base of
the section data which owns the relocation record to the first
byte of relocatable information. The actual data relocated
will be relative to this point; for example, a relocation
type which modifies the bottom two bytes of a four byte word
would not touch the first byte pointed to in a big endian
world.

     <ul>
<li><code>addend</code>
</ul>
   The <code>addend</code> is a value provided by the back end to be added (!) 
to the relocation offset. Its interpretation is dependent upon
the howto. For example, on the 68k the code:

<pre class="example">             char foo[];
             main()
                     {
                     return foo[0x12345678];
                     }
</pre>
   <p>Could be compiled into:

<pre class="example">             linkw fp,#-4
             moveb @#12345678,d0
             extbl d0
             unlk fp
             rts
</pre>
   <p>This could create a reloc pointing to <code>foo</code>, but leave the
offset in the data, something like:

<pre class="example">     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000006 32        _foo
     
     00000000 4e56 fffc          ; linkw fp,#-4
     00000004 1039 1234 5678     ; moveb @#12345678,d0
     0000000a 49c0               ; extbl d0
     0000000c 4e5e               ; unlk fp
     0000000e 4e75               ; rts
</pre>
   <p>Using coff and an 88k, some instructions don't have enough
space in them to represent the full address range, and
pointers have to be loaded in two parts. So you'd get something like:

<pre class="example">             or.u     r13,r0,hi16(_foo+0x12345678)
             ld.b     r2,r13,lo16(_foo+0x12345678)
             jmp      r1
</pre>
   <p>This should create two relocs, both pointing to <code>_foo</code>, and with
0x12340000 in their addend field. The data would consist of:

<pre class="example">     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000002 HVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
     00000006 LVRT16    _foo+0x12340000
     
     00000000 5da05678           ; or.u r13,r0,0x5678
     00000004 1c4d5678           ; ld.b r2,r13,0x5678
     00000008 f400c001           ; jmp r1
</pre>
   <p>The relocation routine digs out the value from the data, adds
it to the addend to get the original offset, and then adds the
value of <code>_foo</code>. Note that all 32 bits have to be kept around
somewhere, to cope with carry from bit 15 to bit 16.

   <p>One further example is the sparc and the a.out format. The
sparc has a similar problem to the 88k, in that some
instructions don't have room for an entire offset, but on the
sparc the parts are created in odd sized lumps. The designers of
the a.out format chose to not use the data within the section
for storing part of the offset; all the offset is kept within
the reloc. Anything in the data should be ignored.

<pre class="example">             save %sp,-112,%sp
             sethi %hi(_foo+0x12345678),%g2
             ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0x12345678)],%i0
             ret
             restore
</pre>
   <p>Both relocs contain a pointer to <code>foo</code>, and the offsets
contain junk.

<pre class="example">     RELOCATION RECORDS FOR [.text]:
     offset   type      value
     00000004 HI22      _foo+0x12345678
     00000008 LO10      _foo+0x12345678
     
     00000000 9de3bf90     ; save %sp,-112,%sp
     00000004 05000000     ; sethi %hi(_foo+0),%g2
     00000008 f048a000     ; ldsb [%g2+%lo(_foo+0)],%i0
     0000000c 81c7e008     ; ret
     00000010 81e80000     ; restore
</pre>
     <ul>
<li><code>howto</code>
</ul>
   The <code>howto</code> field can be imagined as a
relocation instruction. It is a pointer to a structure which
contains information on what to do with all of the other
information in the reloc record and data section. A back end
would normally have a relocation instruction set and turn
relocations into pointers to the correct structure on input -
but it would be possible to create each howto field on demand.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.10.1.1 <code>enum complain_overflow</code></h5>

<p>Indicates what sort of overflow checking should be done when
performing a relocation.

<pre class="example">     
     enum complain_overflow
     {
       /* Do not complain on overflow.  */
       complain_overflow_dont,
     
       /* Complain if the value overflows when considered as a signed
          number one bit larger than the field.  ie. A bitfield of N bits
          is allowed to represent -2**n to 2**n-1.  */
       complain_overflow_bitfield,
     
       /* Complain if the value overflows when considered as a signed
          number.  */
       complain_overflow_signed,
     
       /* Complain if the value overflows when considered as an
          unsigned number.  */
       complain_overflow_unsigned
     };
</pre>
   <h5 class="subsubsection">2.10.1.2 <code>reloc_howto_type</code></h5>

<p>The <code>reloc_howto_type</code> is a structure which contains all the
information that libbfd needs to know to tie up a back end's data.

<pre class="example">     struct bfd_symbol;             /* Forward declaration.  */
     
     struct reloc_howto_struct

           in this field.  For example, a PC relative word relocation
           in a coff environment has the type 023 - because that's
           what the outside world calls a R_PCRWORD reloc.  */

       enum complain_overflow complain_on_overflow;
     
       /* If this field is non null, then the supplied function is
          called rather than the normal function.  This allows really
          strange relocation methods to be accommodated (e.g., i960 callj

          distinction between USE_REL and USE_RELA (though the code checks
          for USE_REL == 1/0).  The value of this field is TRUE if the
          addend is recorded with the section contents; when performing a
          partial link (ld -r) the section contents (the data) will be

          However, the converse is not true: not all relocations of all ELF
          USE_REL targets set this field to TRUE.  Why this is so is peculiar

reflecting the results of partial linkage in an output file:
by modifying the output data in place, and by modifying the
relocation record.  Some native formats (e.g., basic a.out and
basic coff) have no way of specifying an addend in the
relocation type, so the addend has to go in the output data. 
This is no big deal since in these formats the output data
slot will always be big enough for the addend. Complex reloc
types with addends were invented to solve just this problem. 
The <var>error_message</var> argument is set to an error message if

   <p><strong>Description</strong><br>
This looks remarkably like <code>bfd_perform_relocation</code>, except it
does not expect that the section contents have been filled in. 
I.e., it's suitable for use when creating, rather than applying
a relocation.

   <p>For now, this function should be considered reserved for the
assembler.
