<h5 class="subsubsection">2.18.4.2 Write the derived creation routine</h5>

<p>You must write a routine which will create and initialize an
entry in the hash table.  This routine is passed as the
function argument to <code>bfd_hash_table_init</code>.

   <p>In order to permit other hash tables to be derived from the
hash table you are creating, this routine must be written in a
standard way.

   <p>The first argument to the creation routine is a pointer to a
hash table entry.  This may be <code>NULL</code>, in which case the
routine should allocate the right amount of space.  Otherwise
the space has already been allocated by a hash table type
derived from this one.

   <p>After allocating space, the creation routine must call the
creation routine of the hash table type it is derived from,
passing in a pointer to the space it just allocated.  This
will initialize any fields used by the base hash table.

   <p>Finally the creation routine must initialize any local fields
for the new hash table type.

   <p>Here is a boilerplate example of a creation routine. 
<var>function_name</var> is the name of the routine. 
<var>entry_type</var> is the type of an entry in the hash table you
are creating.  <var>base_newfunc</var> is the name of the creation
routine of the hash table type your hash table is derived
from.

<pre class="example">     struct bfd_hash_entry *
     <var>function_name</var> (struct bfd_hash_entry *entry,
                          struct bfd_hash_table *table,
                          const char *string)
     {
       struct <var>entry_type</var> *ret = (<var>entry_type</var> *) entry;
     
      /* Allocate the structure if it has not already been allocated by a
         derived class.  */
       if (ret == NULL)
         {
           ret = bfd_hash_allocate (table, sizeof (* ret));
           if (ret == NULL)
             return NULL;
         }
     
      /* Call the allocation method of the base class.  */
       ret = ((<var>entry_type</var> *)
             <var>base_newfunc</var> ((struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret, table, string));
     
      /* Initialize the local fields here.  */
     
       return (struct bfd_hash_entry *) ret;
     }
</pre>
   <p><strong>Description</strong><br>
The creation routine for the linker hash table, which is in
<code>linker.c</code>, looks just like this example. 
<var>function_name</var> is <code>_bfd_link_hash_newfunc</code>. 
<var>entry_type</var> is <code>struct bfd_link_hash_entry</code>. 
<var>base_newfunc</var> is <code>bfd_hash_newfunc</code>, the creation
routine for a basic hash table.

   <p><code>_bfd_link_hash_newfunc</code> also initializes the local fields
in a linker hash table entry: <code>type</code>, <code>written</code> and
<code>next</code>.
