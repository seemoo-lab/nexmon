<h4 class="subsection">6.58.20 PowerPC AltiVec Built-in Functions</h4>

<p>GCC provides an interface for the PowerPC family of processors to access
the AltiVec operations described in Motorola's AltiVec Programming
Interface Manual.  The interface is made available by including
<code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> and using <samp><span class="option">-maltivec</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="option">-mabi=altivec</span></samp>.  The interface supports the following vector
types.

<pre class="smallexample">     vector unsigned char
     vector signed char
     vector bool char
     
     vector unsigned short
     vector signed short
     vector bool short
     vector pixel
     
     vector unsigned int
     vector signed int
     vector bool int
     vector float
</pre>
 <p>If <samp><span class="option">-mvsx</span></samp> is used the following additional vector types are
implemented.

<pre class="smallexample">     vector unsigned long
     vector signed long
     vector double
</pre>
 <p>The long types are only implemented for 64-bit code generation, and
the long type is only used in the floating point/integer conversion
instructions.

 <p>GCC's implementation of the high-level language interface available from
C and C++ code differs from Motorola's documentation in several ways.

     <ul>
<li>A vector constant is a list of constant expressions within curly braces.

     <li>A vector initializer requires no cast if the vector constant is of the
same type as the variable it is initializing.

     <li>If <code>signed</code> or <code>unsigned</code> is omitted, the signedness of the
vector type is the default signedness of the base type.  The default
varies depending on the operating system, so a portable program should
always specify the signedness.

     <li>Compiling with <samp><span class="option">-maltivec</span></samp> adds keywords <code>__vector</code>,
<code>vector</code>, <code>__pixel</code>, <code>pixel</code>, <code>__bool</code> and
<code>bool</code>.  When compiling ISO C, the context-sensitive substitution
of the keywords <code>vector</code>, <code>pixel</code> and <code>bool</code> is
disabled.  To use them, you must include <code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> instead.

     <li>GCC allows using a <code>typedef</code> name as the type specifier for a
vector type.

     <li>For C, overloaded functions are implemented with macros so the following
does not work:

     <pre class="smallexample">            vec_add ((vector signed int){1, 2, 3, 4}, foo);
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">Since <code>vec_add</code> is a macro, the vector constant in the example
is treated as four separate arguments.  Wrap the entire argument in
parentheses for this to work. 
</ul>

 <p><em>Note:</em> Only the <code>&lt;altivec.h&gt;</code> interface is supported. 
Internally, GCC uses built-in functions to achieve the functionality in
the aforementioned header file, but they are not supported and are
subject to change without notice.

 <p>The following interfaces are supported for the generic and specific
AltiVec operations and the AltiVec predicates.  In cases where there
is a direct mapping between generic and specific operations, only the
generic names are shown here, although the specific operations can also
be used.

 <p>Arguments that are documented as <code>const int</code> require literal
integral values within the range required for that operation.

 <p>If the ISA 2.07 additions to the vector/scalar (power8-vector)
instruction set is available, the following additional functions are
available for 64-bit targets.  New vector types
(<var>vector __int128_t</var> and <var>vector __uint128_t</var>) are available
to hold the <var>__int128_t</var> and <var>__uint128_t</var> types to use these
builtins.

 <p>The normal vector extract, and set operations work on
<var>vector __int128_t</var> and <var>vector __uint128_t</var> types,
but the index value must be 0.

 <p>The second argument to the <var>__builtin_crypto_vshasigmad</var> and
<var>__builtin_crypto_vshasigmaw</var> builtin functions must be a constant
integer that is 0 or 1.  The third argument to these builtin functions
must be a constant integer in the range of 0 to 15.
