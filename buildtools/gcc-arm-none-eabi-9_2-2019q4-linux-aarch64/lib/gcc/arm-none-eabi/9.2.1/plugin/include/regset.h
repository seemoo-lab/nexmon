/* TODO: regset is just a bitmap in its implementation.  The compiler does
   not consistently use one or the other, i.e. sometimes variables are
   declared as bitmap but they are actually regsets and regset accessors
   are used, and vice versa, or mixed (see e.g. spilled_regs in IRA).

   This should be cleaned up, either by just dropping the regset type, or
   by changing all bitmaps that are really regsets to the regset type.  For
   the latter option, a good start would be to change everything allocated
   on the reg_obstack to regset.  */
