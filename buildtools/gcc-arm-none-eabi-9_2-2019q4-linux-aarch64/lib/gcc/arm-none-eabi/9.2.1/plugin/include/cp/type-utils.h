/* Returns the first tree within T that is directly matched by PRED.  T may be a
   type or PARM_DECL and is incrementally decomposed toward its type-specifier
   until a match is found.  NULL_TREE is returned if PRED does not match any
   part of T.

   This is primarily intended for detecting whether T uses `auto' or a concept
   identifier.  Since either of these can only appear as a type-specifier for
   the declaration in question, only top-level qualifications are traversed;
   find_type_usage does not look through the whole type.  */
