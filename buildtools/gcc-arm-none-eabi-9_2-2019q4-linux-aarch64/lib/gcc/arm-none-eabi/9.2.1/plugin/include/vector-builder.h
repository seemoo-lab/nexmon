/* This class is a wrapper around auto_vec<T> for building vectors of T.
   It aims to encode each vector as npatterns interleaved patterns,
   where each pattern represents a sequence:

     { BASE0, BASE1, BASE1 + STEP, BASE1 + STEP*2, BASE1 + STEP*3, ... }

   The first three elements in each pattern provide enough information
   to derive the other elements.  If all patterns have a STEP of zero,
   we only need to encode the first two elements in each pattern.
   If BASE1 is also equal to BASE0 for all patterns, we only need to
   encode the first element in each pattern.  The number of encoded
   elements per pattern is given by nelts_per_pattern.

   The class can be used in two ways:

   1. It can be used to build a full image of the vector, which is then
      canonicalized by finalize ().  In this case npatterns is initially
      the number of elements in the vector and nelts_per_pattern is
      initially 1.

   2. It can be used to build a vector that already has a known encoding.
      This is preferred since it is more efficient and copes with
      variable-length vectors.  finalize () then canonicalizes the encoding
      to a simpler form if possible.

   The derived class Derived provides this functionality for specific Ts.
   Derived needs to provide the following interface:

      bool equal_p (T elt1, T elt2) const;

	  Return true if elements ELT1 and ELT2 are equal.

      bool allow_steps_p () const;

	  Return true if a stepped representation is OK.  We don't allow
	  linear series for anything other than integers, to avoid problems
	  with rounding.

      bool integral_p (T elt) const;

	  Return true if element ELT can be interpreted as an integer.

      StepType step (T elt1, T elt2) const;

	  Return the value of element ELT2 minus the value of element ELT1,
	  given integral_p (ELT1) && integral_p (ELT2).  There is no fixed
	  choice of StepType.

      T apply_step (T base, unsigned int factor, StepType step) const;

	  Return a vector element with the value BASE + FACTOR * STEP.

      bool can_elide_p (T elt) const;

	  Return true if we can drop element ELT, even if the retained
	  elements are different.  This is provided for TREE_OVERFLOW
	  handling.

      void note_representative (T *elt1_ptr, T elt2);

	  Record that ELT2 is being elided, given that ELT1_PTR points to
	  the last encoded element for the containing pattern.  This is
	  again provided for TREE_OVERFLOW handling.  */

	 Each halving step tries to keep the number of elements per pattern
	 the same.  If that isn't possible, and if all elements are still
	 explicitly encoded, the halving step can instead increase the number
	 of elements per pattern.

	 E.g. for:

	     { 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 }  npatterns == 8  full_nelts == 8

	 we first realize that the second half of the sequence is not

	 for npatterns == 4.  Instead we halve the number of patterns
	 and double the number of elements per pattern, treating this

	 against a background of { 3, 4 | 3, 4 ... }, so the only
	 remaining option for reducing the number of patterns is
	 to use a foreground of { 0, 2 } against a stepped background
	 of { 1, 2 | 3, 4 | 5, 6 ... }.  This is valid because we still
	 haven't elided any elements:

	     { 0, 2 | 3, 4 | 5, 6 }  npatterns == 2

	 This in turn can be reduced to a foreground of { 0 } against a
	 stepped background of { 1 | 2 | 3 ... }:

	     { 0 | 2 | 3 }  npatterns == 1

	 This last step would not have been possible for:

	     { 0, 0 | 3, 4 | 5, 6 }  npatterns == 2.  */
