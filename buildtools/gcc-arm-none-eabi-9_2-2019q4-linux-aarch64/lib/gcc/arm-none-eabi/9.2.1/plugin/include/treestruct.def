   DEFTREESTRUCT(enumeration value, printable name).

   Each enumeration value should correspond with a single member of
   union tree_node.

   These enumerator values are used in order to distinguish members of
   union tree_node for garbage collection purposes, as well as
   specifying what structures contain what other structures in the
   tree_contains_struct array.  */
