/* Implementation of sparse integer sets as a linked list or tree.

   This sparse set representation is suitable for sparse sets with an
   unknown (a priori) universe.

   Sets are represented as double-linked lists of container nodes of
   type "struct bitmap_element" or as a binary trees of the same
   container nodes.  Each container node consists of an index for the
   first member that could be held in the container, a small array of
   integers that represent the members in the container, and pointers
   to the next and previous element in the linked list, or left and
   right children in the tree.  In linked-list form, the container
   nodes in the list are sorted in ascending order, i.e. the head of
   the list holds the element with the smallest member of the set.
   In tree form, nodes to the left have a smaller container index.

   For a given member I in the set:
     - the element for I will have index is I / (bits per element)
     - the position for I within element is I % (bits per element)

   This representation is very space-efficient for large sparse sets, and
   the size of the set can be changed dynamically without much overhead.
   An important parameter is the number of bits per element.  In this
   implementation, there are 128 bits per element.  This results in a
   high storage overhead *per element*, but a small overall overhead if
   the set is very sparse.

   The storage requirements for linked-list sparse sets are O(E), with E->N
   in the worst case (a sparse set with large distances between the values
   of the set members).

   This representation also works well for data flow problems where the size
   of the set may grow dynamically, but care must be taken that the member_p,
   add_member, and remove_member operations occur with a suitable access
   pattern.

   The linked-list set representation works well for problems involving very
   sparse sets.  The canonical example in GCC is, of course, the "set of
   sets" for some CFG-based data flow problems (liveness analysis, dominance
   frontiers, etc.).
   
   For random-access sparse sets of unknown universe, the binary tree
   representation is likely to be a more suitable choice.  Theoretical
   access times for the binary tree representation are better than those
   for the linked-list, but in practice this is only true for truely
   random access.

   Often the most suitable representation during construction of the set
   is not the best choice for the usage of the set.  For such cases, the
   "view" of the set can be changed from one representation to the other.
   This is an O(E) operation:

     * from list to tree view	: bitmap_tree_view
     * from tree to list view	: bitmap_list_view

   Traversing linked lists or trees can be cache-unfriendly.  Performance
   can be improved by keeping container nodes in the set grouped together
   in  memory, using a dedicated obstack for a set (or group of related
   sets).  Elements allocated on obstacks are released to a free-list and
   taken off the free list.  If multiple sets are allocated on the same
   obstack, elements freed from one set may be re-used for one of the other
   sets.  This usually helps avoid cache misses.

   A single free-list is used for all sets allocated in GGC space.  This is
   bad for persistent sets, so persistent sets should be allocated on an
   obstack whenever possible.

   For random-access sets with a known, relatively small universe size, the
   SparseSet or simple bitmap representations may be more efficient than a
   linked-list set.


   LINKED LIST FORM
   ================

   In linked-list form, in-order iterations of the set can be executed
   efficiently.  The downside is that many random-access operations are
   relatively slow, because the linked list has to be traversed to test
   membership (i.e. member_p/ add_member/remove_member).
   
   To improve the performance of this set representation, the last
   accessed element and its index are cached.  For membership tests on
   members close to recently accessed members, the cached last element
   improves membership test to a constant-time operation.

   The following operations can always be performed in O(1) time in
   list view:

     * clear			: bitmap_clear
     * smallest_member		: bitmap_first_set_bit
     * choose_one		: (not implemented, but could be
				   in constant time)

   The following operations can be performed in O(E) time worst-case in
   list view (with E the number of elements in the linked list), but in
   O(1) time with a suitable access patterns:

     * member_p			: bitmap_bit_p
     * add_member		: bitmap_set_bit / bitmap_set_range
     * remove_member		: bitmap_clear_bit / bitmap_clear_range

   The following operations can be performed in O(E) time in list view:

     * cardinality		: bitmap_count_bits
     * largest_member		: bitmap_last_set_bit (but this could
				  in constant time with a pointer to
				  the last element in the chain)
     * set_size			: bitmap_last_set_bit

   In tree view the following operations can all be performed in O(log E)
   amortized time with O(E) worst-case behavior.

     * smallest_member
     * largest_member
     * set_size
     * member_p
     * add_member
     * remove_member

   Additionally, the linked-list sparse set representation supports
   enumeration of the members in O(E) time:

     * forall			: EXECUTE_IF_SET_IN_BITMAP
     * set_copy			: bitmap_copy
     * set_intersection		: bitmap_intersect_p /
				  bitmap_and / bitmap_and_into /
				  EXECUTE_IF_AND_IN_BITMAP
     * set_union		: bitmap_ior / bitmap_ior_into
     * set_difference		: bitmap_intersect_compl_p /
				  bitmap_and_comp / bitmap_and_comp_into /
				  EXECUTE_IF_AND_COMPL_IN_BITMAP
     * set_disjuction		: bitmap_xor_comp / bitmap_xor_comp_into
     * set_compare		: bitmap_equal_p

   Some operations on 3 sets that occur frequently in data flow problems
   are also implemented:

     * A | (B & C)		: bitmap_ior_and_into
     * A | (B & ~C)		: bitmap_ior_and_compl /
				  bitmap_ior_and_compl_into


   BINARY TREE FORM
   ================
   An alternate "view" of a bitmap is its binary tree representation.
   For this representation, splay trees are used because they can be
   implemented using the same data structures as the linked list, with
   no overhead for meta-data (like color, or rank) on the tree nodes.

   In binary tree form, random-access to the set is much more efficient
   than for the linked-list representation.  Downsides are the high cost
   of clearing the set, and the relatively large number of operations
   necessary to balance the tree.  Also, iterating the set members is
   not supported.
   
   As for the linked-list representation, the last accessed element and
   its index are cached, so that membership tests on the latest accessed
   members is a constant-time operation.  Other lookups take O(logE)
   time amortized (but O(E) time worst-case).

   The following operations can always be performed in O(1) time:

     * choose_one		: (not implemented, but could be
				   implemented in constant time)

   The following operations can be performed in O(logE) time amortized
   but O(E) time worst-case, but in O(1) time if the same element is
   accessed.

     * member_p			: bitmap_bit_p
     * add_member		: bitmap_set_bit
     * remove_member		: bitmap_clear_bit

   The following operations can be performed in O(logE) time amortized
   but O(E) time worst-case:

     * smallest_member		: bitmap_first_set_bit
     * largest_member		: bitmap_last_set_bit
     * set_size			: bitmap_last_set_bit

   The following operations can be performed in O(E) time:

     * clear			: bitmap_clear

   The binary tree sparse set representation does *not* support any form
   of enumeration, and does also *not* support logical operations on sets.
   The binary tree representation is only supposed to be used for sets
   on which many random-access membership tests will happen.  */
