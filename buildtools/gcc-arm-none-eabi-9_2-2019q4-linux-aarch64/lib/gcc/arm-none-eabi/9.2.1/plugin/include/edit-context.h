/* A set of changes to the source code.

   The changes are "atomic" - if any changes can't be applied,
   none of them can be (tracked by the m_valid flag).
   Similarly, attempts to add the changes from a rich_location flagged
   as containing invalid changes mean that the whole of the edit_context
   is flagged as invalid.

   A complication here is that fix-its are expressed relative to coordinates
   in the files when they were parsed, before any changes have been made, and
   so if there's more that one fix-it to be applied, we have to adjust
   later fix-its to allow for the changes made by earlier ones.  This
   is done by the various "get_effective_column" methods.  */
