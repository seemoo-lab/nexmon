   Predicates are logical formulas in conjunctive-disjunctive form consisting
   of clauses which are bitmaps specifying a set of condition that must
   be true for a clause to be satisfied. Physically they are represented as
   array of clauses terminated by 0.

   In order to make predicate (possibly) true, all of its clauses must
   be (possibly) true. To make clause (possibly) true, one of conditions
   it mentions must be (possibly) true.

   There are fixed bounds on number of clauses and conditions and all the
   manipulation functions are conservative in positive direction. I.e. we
   may lose precision by thinking that predicate may be true even when it
