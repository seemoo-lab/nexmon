.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The \fBgfortran\fR command supports all the options supported by the
\&\fBgcc\fR command.  Only options specific to \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran are documented
here.
.PP
All \s-1GCC\s0 and \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran options
are accepted both by \fBgfortran\fR and by \fBgcc\fR
(as well as any other drivers built at the same time,
such as \fBg++\fR),
since adding \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran to the \s-1GCC\s0 distribution
enables acceptance of \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran options
by all of the relevant drivers.
.PP
In some cases, options have positive and negative forms;
the negative form of \fB\-ffoo\fR would be \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.
This manual documents only one of these two forms, whichever
one is not the default.

.SS "Options controlling Fortran dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options controlling Fortran dialect"
The following options control the details of the Fortran dialect
accepted by the compiler:
.IP "\fB\-ffree\-form\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffree-form"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-ffixed\-form\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffixed-form"
.PD
Specify the layout used by the source file.  The free form layout
was introduced in Fortran 90.  Fixed form was traditionally used in
older Fortran programs.  When neither option is specified, the source
form is determined by the file extension.
.IP "\fB\-fall\-intrinsics\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fall-intrinsics"
This option causes all intrinsic procedures (including the GNU-specific
extensions) to be accepted.  This can be useful with \fB\-std=f95\fR to
force standard-compliance but get access to the full range of intrinsics
available with \fBgfortran\fR.  As a consequence, \fB\-Wintrinsics\-std\fR
will be ignored and no user-defined procedure with the same name as any
intrinsic will be called except when it is explicitly declared \f(CW\*(C`EXTERNAL\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fd\-lines\-as\-code\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fd-lines-as-code"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fd\-lines\-as\-comments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fd-lines-as-comments"
.PD
Enable special treatment for lines beginning with \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`D\*(C'\fR
in fixed form sources.  If the \fB\-fd\-lines\-as\-code\fR option is
given they are treated as if the first column contained a blank.  If the
\&\fB\-fd\-lines\-as\-comments\fR option is given, they are treated as
comment lines.
.IP "\fB\-fdec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdec"
\&\s-1DEC\s0 compatibility mode. Enables extensions and other features that mimic
the default behavior of older compilers (such as \s-1DEC\s0).
These features are non-standard and should be avoided at all costs.
For details on \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran's implementation of these extensions see the
full documentation.
.Sp
Other flags enabled by this switch are:
\&\fB\-fdollar\-ok\fR \fB\-fcray\-pointer\fR \fB\-fdec\-structure\fR
\&\fB\-fdec\-intrinsic\-ints\fR \fB\-fdec\-static\fR \fB\-fdec\-math\fR
.Sp
If \fB\-fd\-lines\-as\-code\fR/\fB\-fd\-lines\-as\-comments\fR are unset, then
\&\fB\-fdec\fR also sets \fB\-fd\-lines\-as\-comments\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdec\-structure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdec-structure"
Enable \s-1DEC \s0\f(CW\*(C`STRUCTURE\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`RECORD\*(C'\fR as well as \f(CW\*(C`UNION\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`MAP\*(C'\fR, and dot ('.') as a member separator (in addition to '%'). This is
provided for compatibility only; Fortran 90 derived types should be used
instead where possible.
.IP "\fB\-fdec\-intrinsic\-ints\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdec-intrinsic-ints"
Enable B/I/J/K kind variants of existing integer functions (e.g. \s-1BIAND, IIAND,
JIAND,\s0 etc...). For a complete list of intrinsics see the full documentation.
.IP "\fB\-fdec\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdec-math"
Enable legacy math intrinsics such as \s-1COTAN\s0 and degree-valued trigonometric
functions (e.g. \s-1TAND, ATAND,\s0 etc...) for compatability with older code.
.IP "\fB\-fdec\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdec-static"
Enable DEC-style \s-1STATIC\s0 and \s-1AUTOMATIC\s0 attributes to explicitly specify
the storage of variables and other objects.
.IP "\fB\-fdec\-include\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdec-include"
Enable parsing of \s-1INCLUDE\s0 as a statement in addition to parsing it as
\&\s-1INCLUDE\s0 line.  When parsed as \s-1INCLUDE\s0 statement, \s-1INCLUDE\s0 does not have to
be on a single line and can use line continuations.
.IP "\fB\-fdollar\-ok\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdollar-ok"
Allow \fB$\fR as a valid non-first character in a symbol name. Symbols 
that start with \fB$\fR are rejected since it is unclear which rules to
apply to implicit typing as different vendors implement different rules.
Using \fB$\fR in \f(CW\*(C`IMPLICIT\*(C'\fR statements is also rejected.
.IP "\fB\-fbackslash\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbackslash"
Change the interpretation of backslashes in string literals from a single
backslash character to \*(L"C\-style\*(R" escape characters. The following
combinations are expanded \f(CW\*(C`\ea\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eb\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\ef\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\en\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`\er\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\et\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\ev\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\e\e\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`\e0\*(C'\fR to the \s-1ASCII\s0
characters alert, backspace, form feed, newline, carriage return,
horizontal tab, vertical tab, backslash, and \s-1NUL,\s0 respectively.
Additionally, \f(CW\*(C`\ex\*(C'\fR\fInn\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\eu\*(C'\fR\fInnnn\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\eU\*(C'\fR\fInnnnnnnn\fR (where each \fIn\fR is a hexadecimal digit) are
translated into the Unicode characters corresponding to the specified code
points. All other combinations of a character preceded by \e are
unexpanded.
.IP "\fB\-fmodule\-private\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodule-private"
Set the default accessibility of module entities to \f(CW\*(C`PRIVATE\*(C'\fR.
Use-associated entities will not be accessible unless they are explicitly
declared as \f(CW\*(C`PUBLIC\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffixed\-line\-length\-\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffixed-line-length-n"
Set column after which characters are ignored in typical fixed-form
lines in the source file, and, unless \f(CW\*(C`\-fno\-pad\-source\*(C'\fR, through which
spaces are assumed (as if padded to that length) after the ends of short
fixed-form lines.
.Sp
Popular values for \fIn\fR include 72 (the
standard and the default), 80 (card image), and 132 (corresponding
to \*(L"extended-source\*(R" options in some popular compilers).
\&\fIn\fR may also be \fBnone\fR, meaning that the entire line is meaningful
and that continued character constants never have implicit spaces appended
to them to fill out the line.
\&\fB\-ffixed\-line\-length\-0\fR means the same thing as
\&\fB\-ffixed\-line\-length\-none\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-pad\-source\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-pad-source"
By default fixed-form lines have spaces assumed (as if padded to that length)
after the ends of short fixed-form lines.  This is not done either if
\&\fB\-ffixed\-line\-length\-0\fR, \fB\-ffixed\-line\-length\-none\fR or
if \fB\-fno\-pad\-source\fR option is used.  With any of those options
continued character constants never have implicit spaces appended
to them to fill out the line.
.IP "\fB\-ffree\-line\-length\-\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffree-line-length-n"
Set column after which characters are ignored in typical free-form
lines in the source file. The default value is 132.
\&\fIn\fR may be \fBnone\fR, meaning that the entire line is meaningful.
\&\fB\-ffree\-line\-length\-0\fR means the same thing as
\&\fB\-ffree\-line\-length\-none\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fmax\-identifier\-length=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmax-identifier-length=n"
Specify the maximum allowed identifier length. Typical values are
31 (Fortran 95) and 63 (Fortran 2003 and Fortran 2008).
.IP "\fB\-fimplicit\-none\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fimplicit-none"
Specify that no implicit typing is allowed, unless overridden by explicit
\&\f(CW\*(C`IMPLICIT\*(C'\fR statements.  This is the equivalent of adding
\&\f(CW\*(C`implicit none\*(C'\fR to the start of every procedure.
.IP "\fB\-fcray\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcray-pointer"
Enable the Cray pointer extension, which provides C\-like pointer
functionality.
.IP "\fB\-fopenacc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fopenacc"
Enable the OpenACC extensions.  This includes OpenACC \f(CW\*(C`!$acc\*(C'\fR
directives in free form and \f(CW\*(C`c$acc\*(C'\fR, \f(CW*$acc\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`!$acc\*(C'\fR directives in fixed form, \f(CW\*(C`!$\*(C'\fR conditional
compilation sentinels in free form and \f(CW\*(C`c$\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`*$\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`!$\*(C'\fR sentinels in fixed form, and when linking arranges for the
OpenACC runtime library to be linked in.
.Sp
Note that this is an experimental feature, incomplete, and subject to
change in future versions of \s-1GCC. \s0 See
<\fBhttps://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/OpenACC\fR> for more information.
.IP "\fB\-fopenmp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fopenmp"
Enable the OpenMP extensions.  This includes OpenMP \f(CW\*(C`!$omp\*(C'\fR directives
in free form
and \f(CW\*(C`c$omp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW*$omp\fR and \f(CW\*(C`!$omp\*(C'\fR directives in fixed form,
\&\f(CW\*(C`!$\*(C'\fR conditional compilation sentinels in free form
and \f(CW\*(C`c$\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`*$\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`!$\*(C'\fR sentinels in fixed form, 
and when linking arranges for the OpenMP runtime library to be linked
in.  The option \fB\-fopenmp\fR implies \fB\-frecursive\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-range\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-range-check"
Disable range checking on results of simplification of constant
expressions during compilation.  For example, \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran will give
an error at compile time when simplifying \f(CW\*(C`a = 1. / 0\*(C'\fR.
With this option, no error will be given and \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR will be assigned
the value \f(CW\*(C`+Infinity\*(C'\fR.  If an expression evaluates to a value
outside of the relevant range of [\f(CW\*(C`\-HUGE()\*(C'\fR:\f(CW\*(C`HUGE()\*(C'\fR],
then the expression will be replaced by \f(CW\*(C`\-Inf\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`+Inf\*(C'\fR
as appropriate.
Similarly, \f(CW\*(C`DATA i/Z\*(AqFFFFFFFF\*(Aq/\*(C'\fR will result in an integer overflow
on most systems, but with \fB\-fno\-range\-check\fR the value will
\&\*(L"wrap around\*(R" and \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR will be initialized to \-1 instead.
.IP "\fB\-fdefault\-integer\-8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdefault-integer-8"
Set the default integer and logical types to an 8 byte wide type.  This option
also affects the kind of integer constants like \f(CW42\fR. Unlike
\&\fB\-finteger\-4\-integer\-8\fR, it does not promote variables with explicit
kind declaration.
.IP "\fB\-fdefault\-real\-8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdefault-real-8"
Set the default real type to an 8 byte wide type.  This option also affects
the kind of non-double real constants like \f(CW1.0\fR.  This option promotes
the default width of \f(CW\*(C`DOUBLE PRECISION\*(C'\fR and double real constants
like \f(CW\*(C`1.d0\*(C'\fR to 16 bytes if possible.  If \f(CW\*(C`\-fdefault\-double\-8\*(C'\fR
is given along with \f(CW\*(C`fdefault\-real\-8\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DOUBLE PRECISION\*(C'\fR
and double real constants are not promoted.  Unlike \fB\-freal\-4\-real\-8\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`fdefault\-real\-8\*(C'\fR does not promote variables with explicit kind

beyond the relevant language standard, and warnings are given for the
Fortran 77 features that are permitted but obsolescent in later

Enable preprocessing. The preprocessor is automatically invoked if
the file extension is \fI.fpp\fR, \fI.FPP\fR,  \fI.F\fR, \fI.FOR\fR,
\&\fI.FTN\fR, \fI.F90\fR, \fI.F95\fR, \fI.F03\fR or \fI.F08\fR. Use
this option to manually enable preprocessing of any kind of Fortran file.
.Sp
To disable preprocessing of files with any of the above listed extensions,
use the negative form: \fB\-nocpp\fR.
.Sp
The preprocessor is run in traditional mode. Any restrictions of the
file-format, especially the limits on line length, apply for
preprocessed output as well, so it might be advisable to use the
\&\fB\-ffree\-line\-length\-none\fR or \fB\-ffixed\-line\-length\-none\fR
options.
.IP "\fB\-dM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dM"
Instead of the normal output, generate a list of \f(CW\*(Aq#define\*(Aq\fR
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros. This gives you a way
of finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file \fIfoo.f90\fR, the command
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&          touch foo.f90; gfortran \-cpp \-E \-dM foo.f90
.Ve
.Sp
will show all the predefined macros.
.IP "\fB\-dD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dD"
Like \fB\-dM\fR except in two respects: it does not include the
predefined macros, and it outputs both the \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR directives
and the result of preprocessing. Both kinds of output go to the
standard output file.
.IP "\fB\-dN\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dN"
Like \fB\-dD\fR, but emit only the macro names, not their expansions.
.IP "\fB\-dU\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dU"
Like \fBdD\fR except that only macros that are expanded, or whose
definedness is tested in preprocessor directives, are output; the 
output is delayed until the use or test of the macro; and \f(CW\*(Aq#undef\*(Aq\fR
directives are also output for macros tested but undefined at the time.
.IP "\fB\-dI\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dI"
Output \f(CW\*(Aq#include\*(Aq\fR directives in addition to the result
of preprocessing.
.IP "\fB\-fworking\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fworking-directory"
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that will
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing. When this option is enabled, the preprocessor will emit,
after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the current
working directory followed by two slashes. \s-1GCC\s0 will use this directory,
when it is present in the preprocessed input, as the directory emitted
as the current working directory in some debugging information formats.
This option is implicitly enabled if debugging information is enabled,
but this can be inhibited with the negated form
\&\fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR. If the \fB\-P\fR flag is present
in the command line, this option has no effect, since no \f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR
directives are emitted whatsoever.
.IP "\fB\-idirafter\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-idirafter dir"
Search \fIdir\fR for include files, but do it after all directories
specified with \fB\-I\fR and the standard system directories have
been exhausted. \fIdir\fR is treated as a system include directory.
If dir begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced by
the sysroot prefix; see \fB\-\-sysroot\fR and \fB\-isysroot\fR.
.IP "\fB\-imultilib\fR \fIdir\fR" 4

Use \fIdir\fR as a subdirectory of the directory containing target-specific

Specify \fIprefix\fR as the prefix for subsequent \fB\-iwithprefix\fR

the final \f(CW\*(Aq/\*(Aq\fR.
.IP "\fB\-isysroot\fR \fIdir\fR" 4

Search \fIdir\fR only for header files requested with \f(CW\*(C`#include "file"\*(C'\fR;
they are not searched for \f(CW\*(C`#include <file>\*(C'\fR, before all directories
specified by \fB\-I\fR and before the standard system directories. If
\&\fIdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced by the
sysroot prefix; see \fB\-\-sysroot\fR and \fB\-isysroot\fR.
.IP "\fB\-isystem\fR \fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-isystem dir"
Search \fIdir\fR for header files, after all directories specified by
\&\fB\-I\fR but before the standard system directories. Mark it as a
system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment as is
applied to the standard system directories. If \fIdir\fR begins with
\&\f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced by the sysroot prefix;
see \fB\-\-sysroot\fR and \fB\-isysroot\fR.
.IP "\fB\-nostdinc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdinc"

.IX Item "-C"
Do not discard comments. All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it causes
the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right. For example,
comments appearing at the start of what would be a directive line have the
effect of turning that line into an ordinary source line, since the first
token on the line is no longer a \f(CW\*(Aq#\*(Aq\fR.
.Sp
Warning: this currently handles C\-Style comments only. The preprocessor
does not yet recognize Fortran-style comments.
.IP "\fB\-CC\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CC"
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion. This is like
\&\fB\-C\fR, except that comments contained within macros are also passed
through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
.Sp
In addition to the side-effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the \fB\-CC\fR
option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro to be converted to C\-style
comments. This is to prevent later use of that macro from inadvertently
commenting out the remainder of the source line. The \fB\-CC\fR option
is generally used to support lint comments.
.Sp
Warning: this currently handles C\- and \*(C+\-Style comments only. The
preprocessor does not yet recognize Fortran-style comments.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR\fIname\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-D\fR\fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIdefinition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Dname=definition"
The contents of \fIdefinition\fR are tokenized and processed as if they
appeared during translation phase three in a \f(CW\*(Aq#define\*(Aq\fR directive.
In particular, the definition will be truncated by embedded newline
characters.
.Sp
If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like program
you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect characters such
as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
.Sp
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any). Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you will need
to quote the option. With sh and csh, \f(CW\*(C`\-D\*(Aqname(args...)=definition\*(Aq\*(C'\fR
works.
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options are processed in the order they are
given on the command line. All \-imacros file and \-include file options
are processed after all \-D and \-U options.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR" 4

.SS "Options to request or suppress errors and warnings"
.IX Subsection "Options to request or suppress errors and warnings"
Errors are diagnostic messages that report that the \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran compiler
cannot compile the relevant piece of source code.  The compiler will
continue to process the program in an attempt to report further errors
to aid in debugging, but will not produce any compiled output.
.PP
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions which
are not inherently erroneous but which are risky or suggest there is
likely to be a bug in the program.  Unless \fB\-Werror\fR is specified,
they do not prevent compilation of the program.
.PP
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning \fB\-W\fR,
for example \fB\-Wimplicit\fR to request warnings on implicit
declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also has a
negative form beginning \fB\-Wno\-\fR to turn off warnings;
for example, \fB\-Wno\-implicit\fR.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.
.PP
These options control the amount and kinds of errors and warnings produced
by \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran:
.IP "\fB\-fmax\-errors=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmax-errors=n"
Limits the maximum number of error messages to \fIn\fR, at which point
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Fortran bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the
source code.  If \fIn\fR is 0, there is no limit on the number of error
messages produced.
.IP "\fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsyntax-only"
Check the code for syntax errors, but do not actually compile it.  This
will generate module files for each module present in the code, but no
other output file.

occur in \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran source files, such as use of \fB\ee\fR in a
character constant within a directive like \f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Valid Fortran programs should compile properly with or without
this option.
However, without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional
Fortran features are supported as well.
With this option, many of them are rejected.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-pedantic\fR to check programs for conformance.
They soon find that it does not do quite what they want\-\-\-it finds some

Note this only checks that an explicit interface is present.  It does not
check that the declared interfaces are consistent across program units.
.IP "\fB\-Wimplicit\-procedure\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-ffpe\-trap=\fR\fIlist\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffpe-trap=list"
Specify a list of floating point exception traps to enable.  On most
systems, if a floating point exception occurs and the trap for that
exception is enabled, a \s-1SIGFPE\s0 signal will be sent and the program
being aborted, producing a core file useful for debugging.  \fIlist\fR
is a (possibly empty) comma-separated list of the following
exceptions: \fBinvalid\fR (invalid floating point operation, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`SQRT(\-1.0)\*(C'\fR), \fBzero\fR (division by zero), \fBoverflow\fR
(overflow in a floating point operation), \fBunderflow\fR (underflow
in a floating point operation), \fBinexact\fR (loss of precision
during operation), and \fBdenormal\fR (operation performed on a
denormal value).  The first five exceptions correspond to the five
\&\s-1IEEE 754\s0 exceptions, whereas the last one (\fBdenormal\fR) is not
part of the \s-1IEEE 754\s0 standard but is available on some common
architectures such as x86.
.Sp
The first three exceptions (\fBinvalid\fR, \fBzero\fR, and
\&\fBoverflow\fR) often indicate serious errors, and unless the program
has provisions for dealing with these exceptions, enabling traps for
these three exceptions is probably a good idea.
.Sp
If the option is used more than once in the command line, the lists will
be joined: '\f(CW\*(C`ffpe\-trap=\*(C'\fR\fIlist1\fR \f(CW\*(C`ffpe\-trap=\*(C'\fR\fIlist2\fR'
is equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`ffpe\-trap=\*(C'\fR\fIlist1\fR,\fIlist2\fR.
.Sp
Note that once enabled an exception cannot be disabled (no negative form).
.Sp
Many, if not most, floating point operations incur loss of precision
due to rounding, and hence the \f(CW\*(C`ffpe\-trap=inexact\*(C'\fR is likely to
be uninteresting in practice.
.Sp
By default no exception traps are enabled.

\&\fIlist\fR can be either \fBnone\fR, \fBall\fR or a comma-separated list
of the following exceptions: \fBinvalid\fR, \fBzero\fR, \fBoverflow\fR,
\&\fBunderflow\fR, \fBinexact\fR and \fBdenormal\fR. (See
\&\fB\-ffpe\-trap\fR for a description of the exceptions.)

When a serious runtime error is encountered or a deadly signal is
emitted (segmentation fault, illegal instruction, bus error,
floating-point exception, and the other \s-1POSIX\s0 signals that have the
action \fBcore\fR), the Fortran runtime library tries to output a

These options affect how \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran searches
for files specified by the \f(CW\*(C`INCLUDE\*(C'\fR directive and where it searches

.PP
It also affects the search paths used by \fBcpp\fR when used to preprocess
Fortran source.

.Sp
Also note that the general behavior of \fB\-I\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`INCLUDE\*(C'\fR is pretty much the same as of \fB\-I\fR with
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR in the \fBcpp\fR preprocessor, with regard to
looking for \fIheader.gcc\fR files and other such things.

negative in the \f(CW\*(C`SIGN\*(C'\fR intrinsic.  \fB\-fno\-sign\-zero\fR does not
print the negative sign of zero values (or values rounded to zero for I/O)

referenced in it. Does not affect common blocks. (Some Fortran compilers
provide this option under the name \fB\-static\fR or \fB\-save\fR.)
The default, which is \fB\-fautomatic\fR, uses the stack for local
variables smaller than the value given by \fB\-fmax\-stack\-var\-size\fR.
Use the option \fB\-frecursive\fR to use no static memory.
.Sp
Local variables or arrays having an explicit \f(CW\*(C`SAVE\*(C'\fR attribute are

.IP "\fB\-ff2c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ff2c"
Generate code designed to be compatible with code generated
by \fBg77\fR and \fBf2c\fR.
.Sp
The calling conventions used by \fBg77\fR (originally implemented
in \fBf2c\fR) require functions that return type
default \f(CW\*(C`REAL\*(C'\fR to actually return the C type \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR, and
functions that return type \f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR to return the values via an
extra argument in the calling sequence that points to where to
store the return value.  Under the default \s-1GNU\s0 calling conventions, such
functions simply return their results as they would in \s-1GNU\s0
C\-\-\-default \f(CW\*(C`REAL\*(C'\fR functions return the C type \f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR functions return the \s-1GNU C\s0 type \f(CW\*(C`complex\*(C'\fR.
Additionally, this option implies the \fB\-fsecond\-underscore\fR
option, unless \fB\-fno\-second\-underscore\fR is explicitly requested.
.Sp
This does not affect the generation of code that interfaces with
the \fBlibgfortran\fR library.
.Sp
\&\fICaution:\fR It is not a good idea to mix Fortran code compiled with
\&\fB\-ff2c\fR with code compiled with the default \fB\-fno\-f2c\fR
calling conventions as, calling \f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR or default \f(CW\*(C`REAL\*(C'\fR
functions between program parts which were compiled with different
calling conventions will break at execution time.
.Sp
\&\fICaution:\fR This will break code which passes intrinsic functions
of type default \f(CW\*(C`REAL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR as actual arguments, as
the library implementations use the \fB\-fno\-f2c\fR calling conventions.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-underscoring\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-underscoring"
Do not transform names of entities specified in the Fortran
source file by appending underscores to them.
.Sp
With \fB\-funderscoring\fR in effect, \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran appends one
underscore to external names with no underscores.  This is done to ensure
compatibility with code produced by many \s-1UNIX\s0 Fortran compilers.
.Sp
\&\fICaution\fR: The default behavior of \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran is
incompatible with \fBf2c\fR and \fBg77\fR, please use the
\&\fB\-ff2c\fR option if you want object files compiled with
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Fortran to be compatible with object code created with these
tools.
.Sp
Use of \fB\-fno\-underscoring\fR is not recommended unless you are
experimenting with issues such as integration of \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran into
existing system environments (vis\-a\*`\-vis existing libraries, tools,
and so on).
.Sp
For example, with \fB\-funderscoring\fR, and assuming that \f(CW\*(C`j()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`max_count()\*(C'\fR are external functions while \f(CW\*(C`my_var\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`lvar\*(C'\fR are local variables, a statement like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        I = J() + MAX_COUNT (MY_VAR, LVAR)
.Ve
.Sp
is implemented as something akin to:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        i = j_() + max_count_\|_(&my_var_\|_, &lvar);
.Ve
.Sp
With \fB\-fno\-underscoring\fR, the same statement is implemented as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        i = j() + max_count(&my_var, &lvar);
.Ve
.Sp
Use of \fB\-fno\-underscoring\fR allows direct specification of
user-defined names while debugging and when interfacing \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran
code with other languages.
.Sp
Note that just because the names match does \fInot\fR mean that the
interface implemented by \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran for an external name matches the
interface implemented by some other language for that same name.
That is, getting code produced by \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran to link to code produced
by some other compiler using this or any other method can be only a
small part of the overall solution\-\-\-getting the code generated by
both compilers to agree on issues other than naming can require
significant effort, and, unlike naming disagreements, linkers normally
cannot detect disagreements in these other areas.
.Sp
Also, note that with \fB\-fno\-underscoring\fR, the lack of appended
underscores introduces the very real possibility that a user-defined
external name will conflict with a name in a system library, which
could make finding unresolved-reference bugs quite difficult in some
cases\-\-\-they might occur at program run time, and show up only as
buggy behavior at run time.
.Sp
In future versions of \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran we hope to improve naming and linking
issues so that debugging always involves using the names as they appear
in the source, even if the names as seen by the linker are mangled to
prevent accidental linking between procedures with incompatible
interfaces.
.IP "\fB\-fsecond\-underscore\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsecond-underscore"
By default, \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran appends an underscore to external
names.  If this option is used \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran appends two
underscores to names with underscores and one underscore to external names
with no underscores.  \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran also appends two underscores to
internal names with underscores to avoid naming collisions with external
names.
.Sp
This option has no effect if \fB\-fno\-underscoring\fR is
in effect.  It is implied by the \fB\-ff2c\fR option.
.Sp
Otherwise, with this option, an external name such as \f(CW\*(C`MAX_COUNT\*(C'\fR
is implemented as a reference to the link-time external symbol
\&\f(CW\*(C`max_count_\|_\*(C'\fR, instead of \f(CW\*(C`max_count_\*(C'\fR.  This is required
for compatibility with \fBg77\fR and \fBf2c\fR, and is implied

\&\fB\-fmax\-stack\-var\-size\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-fpack\-derived\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpack-derived"
This option tells \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran to pack derived type members as closely as
possible.  Code compiled with this option is likely to be incompatible
with code compiled without this option, and may execute slower.
.IP "\fB\-frepack\-arrays\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frepack-arrays"
In some circumstances \s-1GNU\s0 Fortran may pass assumed shape array
sections via a descriptor describing a noncontiguous area of memory.
This option adds code to the function prologue to repack the data into
a contiguous block at runtime.
.Sp
This should result in faster accesses to the array.  However it can introduce
significant overhead to the function call, especially  when the passed data
is noncontiguous.
.IP "\fB\-fshort\-enums\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fshort-enums"
This option is provided for interoperability with C code that was
compiled with the \fB\-fshort\-enums\fR option.  It will make
\&\s-1GNU\s0 Fortran choose the smallest \f(CW\*(C`INTEGER\*(C'\fR kind a given
enumerator set will fit in, and give all its enumerators this kind.
.IP "\fB\-fexternal\-blas\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexternal-blas"
This option will make \fBgfortran\fR generate calls to \s-1BLAS\s0 functions
for some matrix operations like \f(CW\*(C`MATMUL\*(C'\fR, instead of using our own
algorithms, if the size of the matrices involved is larger than a given
limit (see \fB\-fblas\-matmul\-limit\fR).  This may be profitable if an
optimized vendor \s-1BLAS\s0 library is available.  The \s-1BLAS\s0 library will have
to be specified at link time.
.IP "\fB\-fblas\-matmul\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fblas-matmul-limit=n"
Only significant when \fB\-fexternal\-blas\fR is in effect.
Matrix multiplication of matrices with size larger than (or equal to) \fIn\fR
will be performed by calls to \s-1BLAS\s0 functions, while others will be
handled by \fBgfortran\fR internal algorithms. If the matrices
involved are not square, the size comparison is performed using the
geometric mean of the dimensions of the argument and result matrices.
.Sp
The default value for \fIn\fR is 30.
.IP "\fB\-finline\-matmul\-limit=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finline-matmul-limit=n"
When front-end optimiztion is active, some calls to the \f(CW\*(C`MATMUL\*(C'\fR
intrinsic function will be inlined.  This may result in code size
increase if the size of the matrix cannot be determined at compile
time, as code for both cases is generated.  Setting
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-finline\-matmul\-limit=0\*(C'\fR will disable inlining in all cases.
Setting this option with a value of \fIn\fR will produce inline code
for matrices with size up to \fIn\fR. If the matrices involved are not
square, the size comparison is performed using the geometric mean of
the dimensions of the argument and result matrices.
.Sp
The default value for \fIn\fR is 30.  The \f(CW\*(C`\-fblas\-matmul\-limit\*(C'\fR
can be used to change this value.
.IP "\fB\-frecursive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frecursive"
Allow indirect recursion by forcing all local arrays to be allocated
on the stack. This flag cannot be used together with
\&\fB\-fmax\-stack\-var\-size=\fR or \fB\-fno\-automatic\fR.
.IP "\fB\-finit\-local\-zero\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finit-local-zero"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-finit\-derived\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finit-derived"
.IP "\fB\-finit\-integer=\fR\fIn\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-finit\-logical=\fR\fI<true|false>\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finit-logical=<true|false>"
.IP "\fB\-finit\-character=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finit-character=n"
.PD
The \fB\-finit\-local\-zero\fR option instructs the compiler to
initialize local \f(CW\*(C`INTEGER\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`REAL\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR
variables to zero, \f(CW\*(C`LOGICAL\*(C'\fR variables to false, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`CHARACTER\*(C'\fR variables to a string of null bytes.  Finer-grained
initialization options are provided by the
\&\fB\-finit\-integer=\fR\fIn\fR,
\&\fB\-finit\-real=\fR\fI<zero|inf|\-inf|nan|snan>\fR (which also initializes
the real and imaginary parts of local \f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR variables),
\&\fB\-finit\-logical=\fR\fI<true|false>\fR, and
\&\fB\-finit\-character=\fR\fIn\fR (where \fIn\fR is an \s-1ASCII\s0 character
value) options.
.Sp
With \fB\-finit\-derived\fR, components of derived type variables will be
initialized according to these flags.  Components whose type is not covered by
an explicit \fB\-finit\-*\fR flag will be treated as described above with
\&\fB\-finit\-local\-zero\fR.
.Sp
These options do not initialize
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
objects with the \s-1POINTER\s0 attribute
.IP "*" 4
allocatable arrays
.IP "*" 4
variables that appear in an \f(CW\*(C`EQUIVALENCE\*(C'\fR statement.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
(These limitations may be removed in future releases).
.Sp
Note that the \fB\-finit\-real=nan\fR option initializes \f(CW\*(C`REAL\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR variables with a quiet NaN. For a signalling NaN
use \fB\-finit\-real=snan\fR; note, however, that compile-time
optimizations may convert them into quiet NaN and that trapping
needs to be enabled (e.g. via \fB\-ffpe\-trap\fR).
.Sp
The \fB\-finit\-integer\fR option will parse the value into an
integer of type \f(CW\*(C`INTEGER(kind=C_LONG)\*(C'\fR on the host.  Said value
is then assigned to the integer variables in the Fortran code, which
might result in wraparound if the value is too large for the kind.
.Sp
Finally, note that enabling any of the \fB\-finit\-*\fR options will
silence warnings that would have been emitted by \fB\-Wuninitialized\fR
for the affected local variables.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-falign\-commons\fR" 4
.IX Item "-falign-commons"
By default, \fBgfortran\fR enforces proper alignment of all variables in a
\&\f(CW\*(C`COMMON\*(C'\fR block by padding them as needed. On certain platforms this is mandatory,
on others it increases performance. If a \f(CW\*(C`COMMON\*(C'\fR block is not declared with
consistent data types everywhere, this padding can cause trouble, and
\&\fB\-fno\-align\-commons\fR can be used to disable automatic alignment. The
same form of this option should be used for all files that share a \f(CW\*(C`COMMON\*(C'\fR block.
To avoid potential alignment issues in \f(CW\*(C`COMMON\*(C'\fR blocks, it is recommended to order
objects from largest to smallest.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-protect\-parens\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-protect-parens"
By default the parentheses in expression are honored for all optimization
levels such that the compiler does not do any re-association. Using
\&\fB\-fno\-protect\-parens\fR allows the compiler to reorder \f(CW\*(C`REAL\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`COMPLEX\*(C'\fR expressions to produce faster code. Note that for the re-association
optimization \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and \fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR
need to be in effect. The parentheses protection is enabled by default, unless
\&\fB\-Ofast\fR is given.
.IP "\fB\-frealloc\-lhs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frealloc-lhs"
An allocatable left-hand side of an intrinsic assignment is automatically
(re)allocated if it is either unallocated or has a different shape. The
option is enabled by default except when \fB\-std=f95\fR is given. See
also \fB\-Wrealloc\-lhs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-faggressive\-function\-elimination\fR" 4
.IX Item "-faggressive-function-elimination"
Functions with identical argument lists are eliminated within
statements, regardless of whether these functions are marked
\&\f(CW\*(C`PURE\*(C'\fR or not. For example, in
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&          a = f(b,c) + f(b,c)
.Ve
.Sp
there will only be a single call to \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR.  This option only works
if \fB\-ffrontend\-optimize\fR is in effect.
.IP "\fB\-ffrontend\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffrontend-optimize"
This option performs front-end optimization, based on manipulating
parts the Fortran parse tree.  Enabled by default by any \fB\-O\fR option
except \fB\-O0\fR and \fB\-Og\fR.  Optimizations enabled by this option
include:

Attempt to interchange loops in the Fortran front end where
