.PP
Only the most useful options are listed here; see below for the
remainder.  \fBg++\fR accepts mostly the same options as \fBgcc\fR.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
When you invoke \s-1GCC,\s0 it normally does preprocessing, compilation,
assembly and linking.  The \*(L"overall options\*(R" allow you to stop this
process at an intermediate stage.  For example, the \fB\-c\fR option
says not to run the linker.  Then the output consists of object files
output by the assembler.
.PP
Other options are passed on to one or more stages of processing.  Some options
control the preprocessor and others the compiler itself.  Yet other
options control the assembler and linker; most of these are not
documented here, since you rarely need to use any of them.
.PP
Most of the command-line options that you can use with \s-1GCC\s0 are useful
for C programs; when an option is only useful with another language
(usually \*(C+), the explanation says so explicitly.  If the description
for a particular option does not mention a source language, you can use
that option with all supported languages.
.PP
The usual way to run \s-1GCC\s0 is to run the executable called \fBgcc\fR, or
\&\fImachine\fR\fB\-gcc\fR when cross-compiling, or
\&\fImachine\fR\fB\-gcc\-\fR\fIversion\fR to run a specific version of \s-1GCC.\s0
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you should invoke \s-1GCC\s0 as \fBg++\fR 
instead.
.PP
The \fBgcc\fR program accepts options and file names as operands.  Many
options have multi-letter names; therefore multiple single-letter options
may \fInot\fR be grouped: \fB\-dv\fR is very different from \fB\-d\ \-v\fR.
.PP
You can mix options and other arguments.  For the most part, the order
you use doesn't matter.  Order does matter when you use several
options of the same kind; for example, if you specify \fB\-L\fR more
than once, the directories are searched in the order specified.  Also,
the placement of the \fB\-l\fR option is significant.
.PP
Many options have long names starting with \fB\-f\fR or with
\&\fB\-W\fR\-\-\-for example,
\&\fB\-fmove\-loop\-invariants\fR, \fB\-Wformat\fR and so on.  Most of
these have both positive and negative forms; the negative form of
\&\fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  This manual documents
only one of these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
.PP
Some options take one or more arguments typically separated either
by a space or by the equals sign (\fB=\fR) from the option name.
Unless documented otherwise, an argument can be either numeric or
a string.  Numeric arguments must typically be small unsigned decimal
or hexadecimal integers.  Hexadecimal arguments must begin with
the \fB0x\fR prefix.  Arguments to options that specify a size
threshold of some sort may be arbitrarily large decimal or hexadecimal
integers followed by a byte size suffix designating a multiple of bytes
such as \f(CW\*(C`kB\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`KiB\*(C'\fR for kilobyte and kibibyte, respectively,
\&\f(CW\*(C`MB\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`MiB\*(C'\fR for megabyte and mebibyte, \f(CW\*(C`GB\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`GiB\*(C'\fR for gigabyte and gigibyte, and so on.  Such arguments are
designated by \fIbyte-size\fR in the following text.  Refer to the \s-1NIST,
IEC,\s0 and other relevant national and international standards for the full
listing and explanation of the binary and decimal byte size prefixes.

.SS "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Kind of Output"
Compilation can involve up to four stages: preprocessing, compilation
proper, assembly and linking, always in that order.  \s-1GCC\s0 is capable of
preprocessing and compiling several files either into several
assembler input files, or into one assembler input file; then each
assembler input file produces an object file, and linking combines all
the object files (those newly compiled, and those specified as input)
into an executable file.
.PP
For any given input file, the file name suffix determines what kind of
compilation is done:

.IP "\fB\-x none\fR" 4
.IX Item "-x none"
Turn off any specification of a language, so that subsequent files are
handled according to their file name suffixes (as they are if \fB\-x\fR
has not been used at all).
.PP
If you only want some of the stages of compilation, you can use
\&\fB\-x\fR (or filename suffixes) to tell \fBgcc\fR where to start, and
one of the options \fB\-c\fR, \fB\-S\fR, or \fB\-E\fR to say where
\&\fBgcc\fR is to stop.  Note that some combinations (for example,
\&\fB\-x cpp-output \-E\fR) instruct \fBgcc\fR to do nothing at all.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
Compile or assemble the source files, but do not link.  The linking
stage simply is not done.  The ultimate output is in the form of an
object file for each source file.
.Sp
By default, the object file name for a source file is made by replacing
the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, \fB.s\fR, etc., with \fB.o\fR.
.Sp
Unrecognized input files, not requiring compilation or assembly, are
ignored.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Stop after the stage of compilation proper; do not assemble.  The output
is in the form of an assembler code file for each non-assembler input
file specified.
.Sp
By default, the assembler file name for a source file is made by
replacing the suffix \fB.c\fR, \fB.i\fR, etc., with \fB.s\fR.
.Sp
Input files that don't require compilation are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
Stop after the preprocessing stage; do not run the compiler proper.  The
output is in the form of preprocessed source code, which is sent to the
standard output.
.Sp
Input files that don't require preprocessing are ignored.
.IP "\fB\-o\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o file"
Place output in file \fIfile\fR.  This applies to whatever
sort of output is being produced, whether it be an executable file,
an object file, an assembler file or preprocessed C code.
.Sp
If \fB\-o\fR is not specified, the default is to put an executable
file in \fIa.out\fR, the object file for
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI\fR in \fI\fIsource\fI.o\fR, its
assembler file in \fI\fIsource\fI.s\fR, a precompiled header file in
\&\fI\fIsource\fI.\fIsuffix\fI.gch\fR, and all preprocessed C source on
standard output.
.IP "\fB\-v\fR" 4
.IX Item "-v"
Print (on standard error output) the commands executed to run the stages
of compilation.  Also print the version number of the compiler driver
program and of the preprocessor and the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-###\fR" 4
.IX Item "-###"
Like \fB\-v\fR except the commands are not executed and arguments
are quoted unless they contain only alphanumeric characters or \f(CW\*(C`./\-_\*(C'\fR.
This is useful for shell scripts to capture the driver-generated command lines.
.IP "\fB\-\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line options
understood by \fBgcc\fR.  If the \fB\-v\fR option is also specified
then \fB\-\-help\fR is also passed on to the various processes
invoked by \fBgcc\fR, so that they can display the command-line options
they accept.  If the \fB\-Wextra\fR option has also been specified
(prior to the \fB\-\-help\fR option), then command-line options that
have no documentation associated with them are also displayed.
.IP "\fB\-\-target\-help\fR" 4
.IX Item "--target-help"
Print (on the standard output) a description of target-specific command-line
options for each tool.  For some targets extra target-specific
information may also be printed.
.IP "\fB\-\-help={\fR\fIclass\fR|[\fB^\fR]\fIqualifier\fR\fB}\fR[\fB,...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "--help={class|[^]qualifier}[,...]"
Print (on the standard output) a description of the command-line
options understood by the compiler that fit into all specified classes
and qualifiers.  These are the supported classes:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBoptimizers\fR" 4
.IX Item "optimizers"
Display all of the optimization options supported by the
compiler.
.IP "\fBwarnings\fR" 4
.IX Item "warnings"
Display all of the options controlling warning messages
produced by the compiler.
.IP "\fBtarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "target"
Display target-specific options.  Unlike the
\&\fB\-\-target\-help\fR option however, target-specific options of the
linker and assembler are not displayed.  This is because those
tools do not currently support the extended \fB\-\-help=\fR syntax.
.IP "\fBparams\fR" 4
.IX Item "params"
Display the values recognized by the \fB\-\-param\fR
option.
.IP "\fIlanguage\fR" 4
.IX Item "language"
Display the options supported for \fIlanguage\fR, where
\&\fIlanguage\fR is the name of one of the languages supported in this
version of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fBcommon\fR" 4
.IX Item "common"
Display the options that are common to all languages.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
These are the supported qualifiers:
.IP "\fBundocumented\fR" 4
.IX Item "undocumented"
Display only those options that are undocumented.
.IP "\fBjoined\fR" 4
.IX Item "joined"
Display options taking an argument that appears after an equal
sign in the same continuous piece of text, such as:
\&\fB\-\-help=target\fR.
.IP "\fBseparate\fR" 4
.IX Item "separate"
Display options taking an argument that appears as a separate word
following the original option, such as: \fB\-o output-file\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Thus for example to display all the undocumented target-specific
switches supported by the compiler, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The sense of a qualifier can be inverted by prefixing it with the
\&\fB^\fR character, so for example to display all binary warning
options (i.e., ones that are either on or off and that do not take an
argument) that have a description, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=warnings,^joined,^undocumented
.Ve
.Sp
The argument to \fB\-\-help=\fR should not consist solely of inverted
qualifiers.
.Sp
Combining several classes is possible, although this usually
restricts the output so much that there is nothing to display.  One
case where it does work, however, is when one of the classes is
\&\fItarget\fR.  For example, to display all the target-specific
optimization options, use:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-\-help=target,optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-\-help=\fR option can be repeated on the command line.  Each
successive use displays its requested class of options, skipping
those that have already been displayed.  If \fB\-\-help\fR is also
specified anywhere on the command line then this takes precedence
over any \fB\-\-help=\fR option.
.Sp
If the \fB\-Q\fR option appears on the command line before the
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR option, then the descriptive text displayed by
\&\fB\-\-help=\fR is changed.  Instead of describing the displayed
options, an indication is given as to whether the option is enabled,
disabled or set to a specific value (assuming that the compiler
knows this at the point where the \fB\-\-help=\fR option is used).
.Sp
Here is a truncated example from the \s-1ARM\s0 port of \fBgcc\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&          % gcc \-Q \-mabi=2 \-\-help=target \-c
\&          The following options are target specific:
\&          \-mabi=                                2
\&          \-mabort\-on\-noreturn                   [disabled]
\&          \-mapcs                                [disabled]
.Ve
.Sp
The output is sensitive to the effects of previous command-line
options, so for example it is possible to find out which optimizations
are enabled at \fB\-O2\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers
.Ve
.Sp
Alternatively you can discover which binary optimizations are enabled
by \fB\-O3\fR by using:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O3 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O3\-opts
\&        gcc \-c \-Q \-O2 \-\-help=optimizers > /tmp/O2\-opts
\&        diff /tmp/O2\-opts /tmp/O3\-opts | grep enabled
.Ve
.RE
.IP "\fB\-\-version\fR" 4
.IX Item "--version"
Display the version number and copyrights of the invoked \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pass-exit-codes"
Normally the \fBgcc\fR program exits with the code of 1 if any
phase of the compiler returns a non-success return code.  If you specify
\&\fB\-pass\-exit\-codes\fR, the \fBgcc\fR program instead returns with
the numerically highest error produced by any phase returning an error
indication.  The C, \*(C+, and Fortran front ends return 4 if an internal
compiler error is encountered.
.IP "\fB\-pipe\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pipe"
Use pipes rather than temporary files for communication between the
various stages of compilation.  This fails to work on some systems where
the assembler is unable to read from a pipe; but the \s-1GNU\s0 assembler has
no trouble.
.IP "\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-specs=file"
Process \fIfile\fR after the compiler reads in the standard \fIspecs\fR
file, in order to override the defaults which the \fBgcc\fR driver
program uses when determining what switches to pass to \fBcc1\fR,
\&\fBcc1plus\fR, \fBas\fR, \fBld\fR, etc.  More than one
\&\fB\-specs=\fR\fIfile\fR can be specified on the command line, and they
are processed in order, from left to right.
.IP "\fB\-wrapper\fR" 4
.IX Item "-wrapper"
Invoke all subcommands under a wrapper program.  The name of the
wrapper program and its parameters are passed as a comma separated
list.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-c t.c \-wrapper gdb,\-\-args
.Ve
.Sp
This invokes all subprograms of \fBgcc\fR under
\&\fBgdb \-\-args\fR, thus the invocation of \fBcc1\fR is
\&\fBgdb \-\-args cc1 ...\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ffile\-prefix\-map=\fR\fIold\fR\fB=\fR\fInew\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffile-prefix-map=old=new"
When compiling files residing in directory \fI\fIold\fI\fR, record
any references to them in the result of the compilation as if the
files resided in directory \fI\fInew\fI\fR instead.  Specifying this
option is equivalent to specifying all the individual
\&\fB\-f*\-prefix\-map\fR options.  This can be used to make reproducible
builds that are location independent.  See also
\&\fB\-fmacro\-prefix\-map\fR and \fB\-fdebug\-prefix\-map\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fplugin=\fR\fIname\fR\fB.so\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fplugin=name.so"
Load the plugin code in file \fIname\fR.so, assumed to be a
shared object to be dlopen'd by the compiler.  The base name of
the shared object file is used to identify the plugin for the
purposes of argument parsing (See
\&\fB\-fplugin\-arg\-\fR\fIname\fR\fB\-\fR\fIkey\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR below).
Each plugin should define the callback functions specified in the

.IP "\fB\-fplugin\-arg\-\fR\fIname\fR\fB\-\fR\fIkey\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fplugin-arg-name-key=value"

Ada specs as child units of parent \fIunit\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdump\-go\-spec=\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdump-go-spec=file"
For input files in any language, generate corresponding Go
declarations in \fIfile\fR.  This generates Go \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`type\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`var\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`func\*(C'\fR declarations which may be a
useful way to start writing a Go interface to code written in some
other language.
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.SS "Compiling \*(C+ Programs"
.IX Subsection "Compiling Programs"
\&\*(C+ source files conventionally use one of the suffixes \fB.C\fR,
\&\fB.cc\fR, \fB.cpp\fR, \fB.CPP\fR, \fB.c++\fR, \fB.cp\fR, or
\&\fB.cxx\fR; \*(C+ header files often use \fB.hh\fR, \fB.hpp\fR,
\&\fB.H\fR, or (for shared template code) \fB.tcc\fR; and
preprocessed \*(C+ files use the suffix \fB.ii\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes
files with these names and compiles them as \*(C+ programs even if you
call the compiler the same way as for compiling C programs (usually
with the name \fBgcc\fR).
.PP
However, the use of \fBgcc\fR does not add the \*(C+ library.
\&\fBg++\fR is a program that calls \s-1GCC\s0 and automatically specifies linking
against the \*(C+ library.  It treats \fB.c\fR,
\&\fB.h\fR and \fB.i\fR files as \*(C+ source files instead of C source
files unless \fB\-x\fR is used.  This program is also useful when
precompiling a C header file with a \fB.h\fR extension for use in \*(C+
compilations.  On many systems, \fBg++\fR is also installed with
the name \fBc++\fR.
.PP
When you compile \*(C+ programs, you may specify many of the same
command-line options that you use for compiling programs in any
language; or command-line options meaningful for C and related
languages; or options that are meaningful only for \*(C+ programs.
.SS "Options Controlling C Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling C Dialect"
The following options control the dialect of C (or languages derived
from C, such as \*(C+, Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+) that the compiler
accepts:
.IP "\fB\-ansi\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ansi"
In C mode, this is equivalent to \fB\-std=c90\fR. In \*(C+ mode, it is
equivalent to \fB\-std=c++98\fR.
.Sp
This turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are incompatible with \s-1ISO
C90 \s0(when compiling C code), or of standard \*(C+ (when compiling \*(C+ code),
such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR keywords, and
predefined macros such as \f(CW\*(C`unix\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`vax\*(C'\fR that identify the
type of system you are using.  It also enables the undesirable and
rarely used \s-1ISO\s0 trigraph feature.  For the C compiler,
it disables recognition of \*(C+ style \fB//\fR comments as well as
the \f(CW\*(C`inline\*(C'\fR keyword.
.Sp
The alternate keywords \f(CW\*(C`_\|_asm_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_inline_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_typeof_\|_\*(C'\fR continue to work despite
\&\fB\-ansi\fR.  You would not want to use them in an \s-1ISO C\s0 program, of
course, but it is useful to put them in header files that might be included
in compilations done with \fB\-ansi\fR.  Alternate predefined macros
such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_unix_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_vax_\|_\*(C'\fR are also available, with or
without \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The \fB\-ansi\fR option does not cause non-ISO programs to be
rejected gratuitously.  For that, \fB\-Wpedantic\fR is required in
addition to \fB\-ansi\fR.
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STRICT_ANSI_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined when the \fB\-ansi\fR
option is used.  Some header files may notice this macro and refrain
from declaring certain functions or defining certain macros that the
\&\s-1ISO\s0 standard doesn't call for; this is to avoid interfering with any
programs that might use these names for other things.
.Sp
Functions that are normally built in but do not have semantics
defined by \s-1ISO C \s0(such as \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ffs\*(C'\fR) are not built-in
functions when \fB\-ansi\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-std=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-std="
Determine the language standard.   This option
is currently only supported when compiling C or \*(C+.
.Sp
The compiler can accept several base standards, such as \fBc90\fR or
\&\fBc++98\fR, and \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of those standards, such as
\&\fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu++98\fR.  When a base standard is specified, the
compiler accepts all programs following that standard plus those
using \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not contradict it.  For example,
\&\fB\-std=c90\fR turns off certain features of \s-1GCC\s0 that are
incompatible with \s-1ISO C90,\s0 such as the \f(CW\*(C`asm\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeof\*(C'\fR
keywords, but not other \s-1GNU\s0 extensions that do not have a meaning in
\&\s-1ISO C90,\s0 such as omitting the middle term of a \f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR
expression. On the other hand, when a \s-1GNU\s0 dialect of a standard is
specified, all features supported by the compiler are enabled, even when
those features change the meaning of the base standard.  As a result, some
strict-conforming programs may be rejected.  The particular standard
is used by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to identify which features are \s-1GNU\s0
extensions given that version of the standard. For example
\&\fB\-std=gnu90 \-Wpedantic\fR warns about \*(C+ style \fB//\fR
comments, while \fB\-std=gnu99 \-Wpedantic\fR does not.

Don't recognize built-in functions that do not begin with
\&\fB_\|_builtin_\fR as prefix.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally generates special code to handle certain built-in functions
more efficiently; for instance, calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR may become single
instructions which adjust the stack directly, and calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR
may become inline copy loops.  The resulting code is often both smaller
and faster, but since the function calls no longer appear as such, you
cannot set a breakpoint on those calls, nor can you change the behavior
of the functions by linking with a different library.  In addition,
when a function is recognized as a built-in function, \s-1GCC\s0 may use
information about that function to warn about problems with calls to
that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the
resulting code still contains calls to that function.  For example,
warnings are given with \fB\-Wformat\fR for bad calls to
\&\f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR when \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR is built in and \f(CW\*(C`strlen\*(C'\fR is
known not to modify global memory.
.Sp
With the \fB\-fno\-builtin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option
only the built-in function \fIfunction\fR is
disabled.  \fIfunction\fR must not begin with \fB_\|_builtin_\fR.  If a
function is named that is not built-in in this version of \s-1GCC,\s0 this
option is ignored.  There is no corresponding
\&\fB\-fbuiltin\-\fR\fIfunction\fR option; if you wish to enable
built-in functions selectively when using \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR or

Let the type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR be unsigned, like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Each kind of machine has a default for what \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR should
be.  It is either like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR by default or like
\&\f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR by default.
.Sp
Ideally, a portable program should always use \f(CW\*(C`signed char\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`unsigned char\*(C'\fR when it depends on the signedness of an object.
But many programs have been written to use plain \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR and
expect it to be signed, or expect it to be unsigned, depending on the
machines they were written for.  This option, and its inverse, let you
make such a program work with the opposite default.
.Sp
The type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR is always a distinct type from each of

.SS "Options Controlling \*(C+ Dialect"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Dialect"
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for \*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of the \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options
regardless of what language your program is in.  For example, you
might compile a file \fIfirstClass.C\fR like this:

.PP
In this example, only \fB\-fstrict\-enums\fR is an option meant
only for \*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with any
language supported by \s-1GCC.\s0
.PP
Some options for compiling C programs, such as \fB\-std\fR, are also
relevant for \*(C+ programs.

Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling \*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fabi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI. \s0 The default is version 0.
.Sp
Version 0 refers to the version conforming most closely to
the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 specification.  Therefore, the \s-1ABI\s0 obtained using version 0
will change in different versions of G++ as \s-1ABI\s0 bugs are fixed.
.Sp
Version 1 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++ 3.2.
.Sp
Version 2 is the version of the \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 that first appeared in G++
3.4, and was the default through G++ 4.9.
.Sp
Version 3 corrects an error in mangling a constant address as a
template argument.
.Sp
Version 4, which first appeared in G++ 4.5, implements a standard
mangling for vector types.
.Sp
Version 5, which first appeared in G++ 4.6, corrects the mangling of
attribute const/volatile on function pointer types, decltype of a
plain decl, and use of a function parameter in the declaration of
another parameter.
.Sp
Version 6, which first appeared in G++ 4.7, corrects the promotion
behavior of \*(C+11 scoped enums and the mangling of template argument
packs, const/static_cast, prefix ++ and \-\-, and a class scope function
used as a template argument.
.Sp
Version 7, which first appeared in G++ 4.8, that treats nullptr_t as a
builtin type and corrects the mangling of lambdas in default argument
scope.
.Sp
Version 8, which first appeared in G++ 4.9, corrects the substitution
behavior of function types with function-cv-qualifiers.
.Sp
Version 9, which first appeared in G++ 5.2, corrects the alignment of
\&\f(CW\*(C`nullptr_t\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Version 10, which first appeared in G++ 6.1, adds mangling of
attributes that affect type identity, such as ia32 calling convention
attributes (e.g. \fBstdcall\fR).
.Sp
Version 11, which first appeared in G++ 7, corrects the mangling of
sizeof... expressions and operator names.  For multiple entities with
the same name within a function, that are declared in different scopes,
the mangling now changes starting with the twelfth occurrence.  It also
implies \fB\-fnew\-inheriting\-ctors\fR.
.Sp
Version 12, which first appeared in G++ 8, corrects the calling
conventions for empty classes on the x86_64 target and for classes
with only deleted copy/move constructors.  It accidentally changes the
calling convention for classes with a deleted copy constructor and a
trivial move constructor.
.Sp
Version 13, which first appeared in G++ 8.2, fixes the accidental
change in version 12.

On targets that support strong aliases, G++
works around mangling changes by creating an alias with the correct
mangled name when defining a symbol with an incorrect mangled name.
This switch specifies which \s-1ABI\s0 version to use for the alias.
.Sp
With \fB\-fabi\-version=0\fR (the default), this defaults to 11 (\s-1GCC 7\s0
compatibility).  If another \s-1ABI\s0 version is explicitly selected, this
defaults to 0.  For compatibility with \s-1GCC\s0 versions 3.2 through 4.9,
use \fB\-fabi\-compat\-version=2\fR.

If this option is not provided but \fB\-Wabi=\fR\fIn\fR is, that

deprecated, and may be removed in a future version of G++.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-constructors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-constructors"
The \*(C+ standard allows an implementation to omit creating a temporary

Specifying this option disables that optimization, and forces G++ to
call the copy constructor in all cases.  This option also causes G++
to call trivial member functions which otherwise would be expanded inline.
.Sp
In \*(C+17, the compiler is required to omit these temporaries, but this
option still affects trivial member functions.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-enforce\-eh\-specs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-enforce-eh-specs"
Don't generate code to check for violation of exception specifications
at run time.  This option violates the \*(C+ standard, but may be useful
for reducing code size in production builds, much like defining
\&\f(CW\*(C`NDEBUG\*(C'\fR.  This does not give user code permission to throw
exceptions in violation of the exception specifications; the compiler
still optimizes based on the specifications, so throwing an
unexpected exception results in undefined behavior at run time.

.PD
The \*(C+11 and OpenMP standards allow \f(CW\*(C`thread_local\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`threadprivate\*(C'\fR variables to have dynamic (runtime)
initialization.  To support this, any use of such a variable goes
through a wrapper function that performs any necessary initialization.
When the use and definition of the variable are in the same
translation unit, this overhead can be optimized away, but when the
use is in a different translation unit there is significant overhead
even if the variable doesn't actually need dynamic initialization.  If
the programmer can be sure that no use of the variable in a
non-defining \s-1TU\s0 needs to trigger dynamic initialization (either
because the variable is statically initialized, or a use of the
variable in the defining \s-1TU\s0 will be executed before any uses in
another \s-1TU\s0), they can avoid this overhead with the
\&\fB\-fno\-extern\-tls\-init\fR option.

.IX Item "-fnothrow-opt"
Treat a \f(CW\*(C`throw()\*(C'\fR exception specification as if it were a
\&\f(CW\*(C`noexcept\*(C'\fR specification to reduce or eliminate the text size
overhead relative to a function with no exception specification.  If
the function has local variables of types with non-trivial
destructors, the exception specification actually makes the
function smaller because the \s-1EH\s0 cleanups for those variables can be
optimized away.  The semantic effect is that an exception thrown out of
a function with such an exception specification results in a call
to \f(CW\*(C`terminate\*(C'\fR rather than \f(CW\*(C`unexpected\*(C'\fR.

Downgrade some diagnostics about nonconformant code from errors to

nonconforming code to compile.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-pretty-templates"
When an error message refers to a specialization of a function
template, the compiler normally prints the signature of the
template followed by the template arguments and any typedefs or
typenames in the signature (e.g. \f(CW\*(C`void f(T) [with T = int]\*(C'\fR
rather than \f(CW\*(C`void f(int)\*(C'\fR) so that it's clear which template is
involved.  When an error message refers to a specialization of a class
template, the compiler omits any template arguments that match
the default template arguments for that template.  If either of these
behaviors make it harder to understand the error message rather than
easier, you can use \fB\-fno\-pretty\-templates\fR to disable them.
.IP "\fB\-frepo\fR" 4

Disable generation of information about every class with virtual
functions for use by the \*(C+ run-time type identification features
(\f(CW\*(C`dynamic_cast\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`typeid\*(C'\fR).  If you don't use those parts
of the language, you can save some space by using this flag.  Note that
exception handling uses the same information, but G++ generates it as
needed. The \f(CW\*(C`dynamic_cast\*(C'\fR operator can still be used for casts that
do not require run-time type information, i.e. casts to \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR or to
unambiguous base classes.
.Sp
Mixing code compiled with \fB\-frtti\fR with that compiled with

deallocation functions that, for example, use the size of the object

Allow the compiler to optimize using the assumption that a value of
enumerated type can only be one of the values of the enumeration (as
defined in the \*(C+ standard; basically, a value that can be
represented in the minimum number of bits needed to represent all the
enumerators).  This assumption may not be valid if the program uses a
cast to convert an arbitrary integer value to the enumerated type.
.IP "\fB\-fstrong\-eval\-order\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrong-eval-order"
Evaluate member access, array subscripting, and shift expressions in
left-to-right order, and evaluate assignment in right-to-left order,
as adopted for \*(C+17.  Enabled by default with \fB\-std=c++17\fR.
\&\fB\-fstrong\-eval\-order=some\fR enables just the ordering of member

.IX Item "-ftemplate-depth=n"
Set the maximum instantiation depth for template classes to \fIn\fR.
A limit on the template instantiation depth is needed to detect
endless recursions during template class instantiation.  \s-1ANSI/ISO \*(C+\s0
conforming programs must not rely on a maximum depth greater than 17

Do not emit the extra code to use the routines specified in the \*(C+

.IX Item "-fuse-cxa-atexit"
Register destructors for objects with static storage duration with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR function rather than the \f(CW\*(C`atexit\*(C'\fR function.
This option is required for fully standards-compliant handling of static
destructors, but only works if your C library supports
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_atexit\*(C'\fR.

.IX Item "-fno-use-cxa-get-exception-ptr"
Don't use the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_cxa_get_exception_ptr\*(C'\fR runtime routine.  This

if the runtime routine is not available.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-inlines\-hidden\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-inlines-hidden"
This switch declares that the user does not attempt to compare
pointers to inline functions or methods where the addresses of the two functions
are taken in different shared objects.
.Sp
The effect of this is that \s-1GCC\s0 may, effectively, mark inline methods with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility ("hidden")))\*(C'\fR so that they do not
appear in the export table of a \s-1DSO\s0 and do not require a \s-1PLT\s0 indirection
when used within the \s-1DSO. \s0 Enabling this option can have a dramatic effect
on load and link times of a \s-1DSO\s0 as it massively reduces the size of the
dynamic export table when the library makes heavy use of templates.
.Sp
The behavior of this switch is not quite the same as marking the
methods as hidden directly, because it does not affect static variables
local to the function or cause the compiler to deduce that
the function is defined in only one shared object.
.Sp
You may mark a method as having a visibility explicitly to negate the
effect of the switch for that method.  For example, if you do want to
compare pointers to a particular inline method, you might mark it as
having default visibility.  Marking the enclosing class with explicit
visibility has no effect.
.Sp
Explicitly instantiated inline methods are unaffected by this option
as their linkage might otherwise cross a shared library boundary.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility\-ms\-compat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility-ms-compat"
This flag attempts to use visibility settings to make \s-1GCC\s0's \*(C+

\&\fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR.
.IP "2." 4
.IX Item "2."
Types, but not their members, are not hidden by default.
.IP "3." 4
.IX Item "3."
The One Definition Rule is relaxed for types without explicit
visibility specifications that are defined in more than one
shared object: those declarations are permitted if they are
permitted when this option is not used.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
In new code it is better to use \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR and
export those classes that are intended to be externally visible.
Unfortunately it is possible for code to rely, perhaps accidentally,
on the Visual Studio behavior.
.Sp
Among the consequences of these changes are that static data members
of the same type with the same name but defined in different shared
objects are different, so changing one does not change the other;
and that pointers to function members defined in different shared
objects may not compare equal.  When this flag is given, it is a
violation of the \s-1ODR\s0 to define types with the same name differently.

Warn when G++ it generates code that is probably not compatible with
the vendor-neutral \*(C+ \s-1ABI. \s0 Since G++ now defaults to updating the

there is a check added later in a release series for an \s-1ABI\s0 issue
discovered since the initial release.  \fB\-Wabi\fR will warn about
more things if an older \s-1ABI\s0 version is selected (with
\&\fB\-fabi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR).
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wabi\fR can also be used with an explicit version number to
warn about compatibility with a particular \fB\-fabi\-version\fR
level, e.g. \fB\-Wabi=2\fR to warn about changes relative to
\&\fB\-fabi\-version=2\fR.
.Sp
If an explicit version number is provided and
\&\fB\-fabi\-compat\-version\fR is not specified, the version number
from this option is used for compatibility aliases.  If no explicit
version number is provided with this option, but
\&\fB\-fabi\-compat\-version\fR is specified, that version number is
used for \s-1ABI\s0 warnings.
.Sp
Although an effort has been made to warn about
all such cases, there are probably some cases that are not warned about,
even though G++ is generating incompatible code.  There may also be
cases where warnings are emitted even though the code that is generated
is compatible.

You should rewrite your code to avoid these warnings if you are
concerned about the fact that code generated by G++ may not be binary
compatible with code generated by other compilers.

.IX Item "-Wliteral-suffix ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a string or character literal is followed by a ud-suffix which does
not begin with an underscore.  As a conforming extension, \s-1GCC\s0 treats such
suffixes as separate preprocessing tokens in order to maintain backwards
compatibility with code that uses formatting macros from \f(CW\*(C`<inttypes.h>\*(C'\fR.
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        #define _\|_STDC_FORMAT_MACROS
\&        #include <inttypes.h>
\&        #include <stdio.h>
\&        
\&        int main() {
\&          int64_t i64 = 123;
\&          printf("My int64: %" PRId64"\en", i64);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In this case, \f(CW\*(C`PRId64\*(C'\fR is treated as a separate preprocessing token.
.Sp
Additionally, warn when a user-defined literal operator is declared with
a literal suffix identifier that doesn't begin with an underscore. Literal
suffix identifiers that don't begin with an underscore are reserved for
future standardization.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wlto\-type\-mismatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlto-type-mismatch"
During the link-time optimization warn about type mismatches in
global declarations from different compilation units.
Requires \fB\-flto\fR to be enabled.  Enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-narrowing\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-narrowing ( and Objective- only)"
For \*(C+11 and later standards, narrowing conversions are diagnosed by default,
as required by the standard.  A narrowing conversion from a constant produces
an error, and a narrowing conversion from a non-constant produces a warning,
but \fB\-Wno\-narrowing\fR suppresses the diagnostic.
Note that this does not affect the meaning of well-formed code;
narrowing conversions are still considered ill-formed in \s-1SFINAE\s0 contexts.
.Sp
With \fB\-Wnarrowing\fR in \*(C+98, warn when a narrowing
conversion prohibited by \*(C+11 occurs within
\&\fB{ }\fR, e.g.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        int i = { 2.2 }; // error: narrowing from double to int
.Ve
.Sp
This flag is included in \fB\-Wall\fR and \fB\-Wc++11\-compat\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wnoexcept\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnoexcept ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a noexcept-expression evaluates to false because of a call
to a function that does not have a non-throwing exception
specification (i.e. \f(CW\*(C`throw()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`noexcept\*(C'\fR) but is known by
the compiler to never throw an exception.
.IP "\fB\-Wnoexcept\-type\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnoexcept-type ( and Objective- only)"
Warn if the \*(C+17 feature making \f(CW\*(C`noexcept\*(C'\fR part of a function
type changes the mangled name of a symbol relative to \*(C+14.  Enabled
by \fB\-Wabi\fR and \fB\-Wc++17\-compat\fR.
.Sp
As an example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        template <class T> void f(T t) { t(); };
\&        void g() noexcept;
\&        void h() { f(g); }
.Ve
.Sp
In \*(C+14, \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR calls \f(CW\*(C`f<void(*)()>\*(C'\fR, but in
\&\*(C+17 it calls \f(CW\*(C`f<void(*)()noexcept>\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wclass\-memaccess\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wclass-memaccess ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when the destination of a call to a raw memory function such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR is an object of class type, and when writing
into such an object might bypass the class non-trivial or deleted constructor
or copy assignment, violate const-correctness or encapsulation, or corrupt
virtual table pointers.  Modifying the representation of such objects may
violate invariants maintained by member functions of the class.  For example,
the call to \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR below is undefined because it modifies a non-trivial
class object and is, therefore, diagnosed.  The safe way to either initialize
or clear the storage of objects of such types is by using the appropriate
constructor or assignment operator, if one is available.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        std::string str = "abc";
\&        memset (&str, 0, sizeof str);
.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-Wclass\-memaccess\fR option is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
Explicitly casting the pointer to the class object to \f(CW\*(C`void *\*(C'\fR or
to a type that can be safely accessed by the raw memory function suppresses
the warning.
.IP "\fB\-Wnon\-virtual\-dtor\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wnon-virtual-dtor ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a class has virtual functions and an accessible non-virtual
destructor itself or in an accessible polymorphic base class, in which
case it is possible but unsafe to delete an instance of a derived
class through a pointer to the class itself or base class.  This
warning is automatically enabled if \fB\-Weffc++\fR is specified.
.IP "\fB\-Wregister\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wregister ( and Objective- only)"
Warn on uses of the \f(CW\*(C`register\*(C'\fR storage class specifier, except
when it is part of the \s-1GNU \s0\fBExplicit Register Variables\fR extension.
The use of the \f(CW\*(C`register\*(C'\fR keyword as storage class specifier has
been deprecated in \*(C+11 and removed in \*(C+17.
Enabled by default with \fB\-std=c++17\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wreorder\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wreorder ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when the order of member initializers given in the code does not
match the order in which they must be executed.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        struct A {
\&          int i;
\&          int j;
\&          A(): j (0), i (1) { }
\&        };
.Ve
.Sp
The compiler rearranges the member initializers for \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`j\*(C'\fR to match the declaration order of the members, emitting
a warning to that effect.  This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pessimizing\-move\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pessimizing-move ( and Objective- only)"
This warning warns when a call to \f(CW\*(C`std::move\*(C'\fR prevents copy
elision.  A typical scenario when copy elision can occur is when returning in
a function with a class return type, when the expression being returned is the
name of a non-volatile automatic object, and is not a function parameter, and
has the same type as the function return type.
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        struct T {
\&        ...
\&        };
\&        T fn()
\&        {
\&          T t;
\&          ...
\&          return std::move (t);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
But in this example, the \f(CW\*(C`std::move\*(C'\fR call prevents copy elision.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-redundant\-move\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-redundant-move ( and Objective- only)"
This warning warns about redundant calls to \f(CW\*(C`std::move\*(C'\fR; that is, when
a move operation would have been performed even without the \f(CW\*(C`std::move\*(C'\fR
call.  This happens because the compiler is forced to treat the object as if
it were an rvalue in certain situations such as returning a local variable,
where copy elision isn't applicable.  Consider:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        struct T {
\&        ...
\&        };
\&        T fn(T t)
\&        {
\&          ...
\&          return std::move (t);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Here, the \f(CW\*(C`std::move\*(C'\fR call is redundant.  Because G++ implements Core
Issue 1579, another example is:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        struct T { // convertible to U
\&        ...
\&        };
\&        struct U {
\&        ...
\&        };
\&        U fn()
\&        {
\&          T t;
\&          ...
\&          return std::move (t);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In this example, copy elision isn't applicable because the type of the
expression being returned and the function return type differ, yet G++
treats the return value as if it were designated by an rvalue.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fext\-numeric\-literals\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-fext-numeric-literals ( and Objective- only)"
Accept imaginary, fixed-point, or machine-defined
literal number suffixes as \s-1GNU\s0 extensions.
When this option is turned off these suffixes are treated
as \*(C+11 user-defined literal numeric suffixes.
This is on by default for all pre\-\*(C+11 dialects and all \s-1GNU\s0 dialects:
\&\fB\-std=c++98\fR, \fB\-std=gnu++98\fR, \fB\-std=gnu++11\fR,
\&\fB\-std=gnu++14\fR.
This option is off by default
for \s-1ISO \*(C+11\s0 onwards (\fB\-std=c++11\fR, ...).
.PP
The following \fB\-W...\fR options are not affected by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Weffc++\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Weffc++ ( and Objective- only)"
Warn about violations of the following style guidelines from Scott Meyers'
\&\fIEffective \*(C+\fR series of books:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Define a copy constructor and an assignment operator for classes
with dynamically-allocated memory.
.IP "*" 4
Prefer initialization to assignment in constructors.
.IP "*" 4
Have \f(CW\*(C`operator=\*(C'\fR return a reference to \f(CW*this\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Don't try to return a reference when you must return an object.
.IP "*" 4
Distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and
decrement operators.
.IP "*" 4
Never overload \f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
This option also enables \fB\-Wnon\-virtual\-dtor\fR, which is also
one of the effective \*(C+ recommendations.  However, the check is
extended to warn about the lack of virtual destructor in accessible
non-polymorphic bases classes too.
.Sp
When selecting this option, be aware that the standard library
headers do not obey all of these guidelines; use \fBgrep \-v\fR
to filter out those warnings.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-null\-sentinel\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-null-sentinel ( and Objective- only)"
Warn about the use of an uncasted \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR as sentinel.  When
compiling only with \s-1GCC\s0 this is a valid sentinel, as \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR is defined
to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_null\*(C'\fR.  Although it is a null pointer constant rather than a
null pointer, it is guaranteed to be of the same size as a pointer.
But this use is not portable across different compilers.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-non\-template\-friend\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-non-template-friend ( and Objective- only)"
Disable warnings when non-template friend functions are declared
within a template.  In very old versions of \s-1GCC\s0 that predate implementation
of the \s-1ISO\s0 standard, declarations such as 
\&\fBfriend int foo(int)\fR, where the name of the friend is an unqualified-id,
could be interpreted as a particular specialization of a template
function; the warning exists to diagnose compatibility problems, 
and is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-cast\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-cast ( and Objective- only)"
Warn if an old-style (C\-style) cast to a non-void type is used within
a \*(C+ program.  The new-style casts (\f(CW\*(C`dynamic_cast\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`static_cast\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`reinterpret_cast\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`const_cast\*(C'\fR) are
less vulnerable to unintended effects and much easier to search for.
.IP "\fB\-Woverloaded\-virtual\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Woverloaded-virtual ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a function declaration hides virtual functions from a
base class.  For example, in:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        struct A {
\&          virtual void f();
\&        };
\&        
\&        struct B: public A {
\&          void f(int);
\&        };
.Ve
.Sp
the \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR class version of \f(CW\*(C`f\*(C'\fR is hidden in \f(CW\*(C`B\*(C'\fR, and code
like:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        B* b;
\&        b\->f();
.Ve
.Sp
fails to compile.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pmf\-conversions\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-pmf-conversions ( and Objective- only)"
Disable the diagnostic for converting a bound pointer to member function
to a plain pointer.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-promo\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-promo ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when overload resolution chooses a promotion from unsigned or
enumerated type to a signed type, over a conversion to an unsigned type of
the same size.  Previous versions of G++ tried to preserve
unsignedness, but the standard mandates the current behavior.
.IP "\fB\-Wtemplates\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtemplates ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a primary template declaration is encountered.  Some coding
rules disallow templates, and this may be used to enforce that rule.
The warning is inactive inside a system header file, such as the \s-1STL,\s0 so
one can still use the \s-1STL. \s0 One may also instantiate or specialize
templates.
.IP "\fB\-Wmultiple\-inheritance\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmultiple-inheritance ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a class is defined with multiple direct base classes.  Some
coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to
enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file,
such as the \s-1STL,\s0 so one can still use the \s-1STL. \s0 One may also define
classes that indirectly use multiple inheritance.
.IP "\fB\-Wvirtual\-inheritance\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvirtual-inheritance"
Warn when a class is defined with a virtual direct base class.  Some
coding rules disallow multiple inheritance, and this may be used to
enforce that rule.  The warning is inactive inside a system header file,
such as the \s-1STL,\s0 so one can still use the \s-1STL. \s0 One may also define
classes that indirectly use virtual inheritance.
.IP "\fB\-Wnamespaces\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wnamespaces"
Warn when a namespace definition is opened.  Some coding rules disallow
namespaces, and this may be used to enforce that rule.  The warning is
inactive inside a system header file, such as the \s-1STL,\s0 so one can still
use the \s-1STL. \s0 One may also use using directives and qualified names.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-terminate\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-terminate ( and Objective- only)"
Disable the warning about a throw-expression that will immediately

.IP "\fB\-Wno\-class\-conversion\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-class-conversion ( and Objective- only)"
Disable the warning about the case when a conversion function converts an

.SS "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialects"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling Objective-C and Objective- Dialects"
(\s-1NOTE:\s0 This manual does not describe the Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
languages themselves.
.PP
This section describes the command-line options that are only meaningful
for Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs.  You can also use most of
the language-independent \s-1GNU\s0 compiler options.
For example, you might compile a file \fIsome_class.m\fR like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-g \-fgnu\-runtime \-O \-c some_class.m
.Ve
.PP
In this example, \fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR is an option meant only for
Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ programs; you can use the other options with
any language supported by \s-1GCC.\s0
.PP
Note that since Objective-C is an extension of the C language, Objective-C
compilations may also use options specific to the C front-end (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR).  Similarly, Objective\-\*(C+ compilations may use
\&\*(C+\-specific options (e.g., \fB\-Wabi\fR).
.PP
Here is a list of options that are \fIonly\fR for compiling Objective-C
and Objective\-\*(C+ programs:
.IP "\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class=\fR\fIclass-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconstant-string-class=class-name"
Use \fIclass-name\fR as the name of the class to instantiate for each
literal string specified with the syntax \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR.  The default
class name is \f(CW\*(C`NXConstantString\*(C'\fR if the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime is being used, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`NSConstantString\*(C'\fR if the NeXT runtime is being used (see below).  The
\&\fB\-fconstant\-cfstrings\fR option, if also present, overrides the
\&\fB\-fconstant\-string\-class\fR setting and cause \f(CW\*(C`@"..."\*(C'\fR literals
to be laid out as constant CoreFoundation strings.
.IP "\fB\-fgnu\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgnu-runtime"
Generate object code compatible with the standard \s-1GNU\s0 Objective-C
runtime.  This is the default for most types of systems.
.IP "\fB\-fnext\-runtime\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnext-runtime"
Generate output compatible with the NeXT runtime.  This is the default
for NeXT-based systems, including Darwin and Mac \s-1OS X. \s0 The macro
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_NEXT_RUNTIME_\|_\*(C'\fR is predefined if (and only if) this option is
used.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-nil\-receivers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-nil-receivers"
Assume that all Objective-C message dispatches (\f(CW\*(C`[receiver
message:arg]\*(C'\fR) in this translation unit ensure that the receiver is
not \f(CW\*(C`nil\*(C'\fR.  This allows for more efficient entry points in the
runtime to be used.  This option is only available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime and \s-1ABI\s0 version 0 or 1.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-abi\-version=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-abi-version=n"
Use version \fIn\fR of the Objective-C \s-1ABI\s0 for the selected runtime.
This option is currently supported only for the NeXT runtime.  In that
case, Version 0 is the traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 without support for
properties and other Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 1 is the
traditional (32\-bit) \s-1ABI\s0 with support for properties and other
Objective-C 2.0 additions.  Version 2 is the modern (64\-bit) \s-1ABI. \s0 If
nothing is specified, the default is Version 0 on 32\-bit target
machines, and Version 2 on 64\-bit target machines.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-call\-cxx\-cdtors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-call-cxx-cdtors"
For each Objective-C class, check if any of its instance variables is a
\&\*(C+ object with a non-trivial default constructor.  If so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR instance method which runs
non-trivial default constructors on any such instance variables, in order,
and then return \f(CW\*(C`self\*(C'\fR.  Similarly, check if any instance variable
is a \*(C+ object with a non-trivial destructor, and if so, synthesize a
special \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR method which runs
all such default destructors, in reverse order.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR
methods thusly generated only operate on instance variables
declared in the current Objective-C class, and not those inherited
from superclasses.  It is the responsibility of the Objective-C
runtime to invoke all such methods in an object's inheritance
hierarchy.  The \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked
by the runtime immediately after a new object instance is allocated;
the \f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods are invoked immediately
before the runtime deallocates an object instance.
.Sp
As of this writing, only the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.4\s0 and later has
support for invoking the \f(CW\*(C`\- (id) .cxx_construct\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`\- (void) .cxx_destruct\*(C'\fR methods.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-direct\-dispatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-direct-dispatch"
Allow fast jumps to the message dispatcher.  On Darwin this is
accomplished via the comm page.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-exceptions"
Enable syntactic support for structured exception handling in
Objective-C, similar to what is offered by \*(C+.  This option
is required to use the Objective-C keywords \f(CW@try\fR,
\&\f(CW@throw\fR, \f(CW@catch\fR, \f(CW@finally\fR and
\&\f(CW@synchronized\fR.  This option is available with both the \s-1GNU\s0
runtime and the NeXT runtime (but not available in conjunction with
the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.2\s0 and earlier).
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-gc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-gc"
Enable garbage collection (\s-1GC\s0) in Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+
programs.  This option is only available with the NeXT runtime; the
\&\s-1GNU\s0 runtime has a different garbage collection implementation that
does not require special compiler flags.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-nilcheck\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-nilcheck"
For the NeXT runtime with version 2 of the \s-1ABI,\s0 check for a nil
receiver in method invocations before doing the actual method call.
This is the default and can be disabled using
\&\fB\-fno\-objc\-nilcheck\fR.  Class methods and super calls are never
checked for nil in this way no matter what this flag is set to.
Currently this flag does nothing when the \s-1GNU\s0 runtime, or an older
version of the NeXT runtime \s-1ABI,\s0 is used.
.IP "\fB\-fobjc\-std=objc1\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fobjc-std=objc1"
Conform to the language syntax of Objective-C 1.0, the language
recognized by \s-1GCC 4.0. \s0 This only affects the Objective-C additions to
the C/\*(C+ language; it does not affect conformance to C/\*(C+ standards,
which is controlled by the separate C/\*(C+ dialect option flags.  When
this option is used with the Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ compiler,
any Objective-C syntax that is not recognized by \s-1GCC 4.0\s0 is rejected.
This is useful if you need to make sure that your Objective-C code can
be compiled with older versions of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\-freplace\-objc\-classes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freplace-objc-classes"
Emit a special marker instructing \fB\f(BIld\fB\|(1)\fR not to statically link in
the resulting object file, and allow \fB\f(BIdyld\fB\|(1)\fR to load it in at
run time instead.  This is used in conjunction with the Fix-and-Continue
debugging mode, where the object file in question may be recompiled and
dynamically reloaded in the course of program execution, without the need
to restart the program itself.  Currently, Fix-and-Continue functionality
is only available in conjunction with the NeXT runtime on Mac \s-1OS X 10.3\s0
and later.
.IP "\fB\-fzero\-link\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fzero-link"
When compiling for the NeXT runtime, the compiler ordinarily replaces calls
to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR (when the name of the class is known at
compile time) with static class references that get initialized at load time,
which improves run-time performance.  Specifying the \fB\-fzero\-link\fR flag
suppresses this behavior and causes calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_getClass("...")\*(C'\fR
to be retained.  This is useful in Zero-Link debugging mode, since it allows
for individual class implementations to be modified during program execution.
The \s-1GNU\s0 runtime currently always retains calls to \f(CW\*(C`objc_get_class("...")\*(C'\fR
regardless of command-line options.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-local\-ivars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-local-ivars"
By default instance variables in Objective-C can be accessed as if
they were local variables from within the methods of the class they're
declared in.  This can lead to shadowing between instance variables
and other variables declared either locally inside a class method or
globally with the same name.  Specifying the \fB\-fno\-local\-ivars\fR
flag disables this behavior thus avoiding variable shadowing issues.
.IP "\fB\-fivar\-visibility=\fR[\fBpublic\fR|\fBprotected\fR|\fBprivate\fR|\fBpackage\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-fivar-visibility=[public|protected|private|package]"
Set the default instance variable visibility to the specified option
so that instance variables declared outside the scope of any access

.IP "\fB\-gen\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gen-decls"
Dump interface declarations for all classes seen in the source file to a

.IP "\fB\-Wassign\-intercept\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wassign-intercept (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn whenever an Objective-C assignment is being intercepted by the
garbage collector.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-protocol (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
If a class is declared to implement a protocol, a warning is issued for
every method in the protocol that is not implemented by the class.  The
default behavior is to issue a warning for every method not explicitly
implemented in the class, even if a method implementation is inherited
from the superclass.  If you use the \fB\-Wno\-protocol\fR option, then
methods inherited from the superclass are considered to be implemented,
and no warning is issued for them.
.IP "\fB\-Wselector\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wselector (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if multiple methods of different types for the same selector are
found during compilation.  The check is performed on the list of methods
in the final stage of compilation.  Additionally, a check is performed
for each selector appearing in a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR
expression, and a corresponding method for that selector has been found
during compilation.  Because these checks scan the method table only at
the end of compilation, these warnings are not produced if the final
stage of compilation is not reached, for example because an error is
found during compilation, or because the \fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR option is
being used.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-selector\-match\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-selector-match (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if multiple methods with differing argument and/or return types are
found for a given selector when attempting to send a message using this
selector to a receiver of type \f(CW\*(C`id\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`Class\*(C'\fR.  When this flag
is off (which is the default behavior), the compiler omits such warnings
if any differences found are confined to types that share the same size
and alignment.
.IP "\fB\-Wundeclared\-selector\fR (Objective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wundeclared-selector (Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression referring to an
undeclared selector is found.  A selector is considered undeclared if no
method with that name has been declared before the
\&\f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression, either explicitly in an
\&\f(CW@interface\fR or \f(CW@protocol\fR declaration, or implicitly in
an \f(CW@implementation\fR section.  This option always performs its
checks as soon as a \f(CW\*(C`@selector(...)\*(C'\fR expression is found,
while \fB\-Wselector\fR only performs its checks in the final stage of
compilation.  This also enforces the coding style convention
that methods and selectors must be declared before being used.

.IX Item "-print-objc-runtime-info"
Generate C header describing the largest structure that is passed by

.SS "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
.IX Subsection "Options to Control Diagnostic Messages Formatting"
Traditionally, diagnostic messages have been formatted irrespective of
the output device's aspect (e.g. its width, ...).  You can use the
options described below
to control the formatting algorithm for diagnostic messages, 
e.g. how many characters per line, how often source location
information should be reported.  Note that some language front ends may not
honor these options.
.IP "\fB\-fmessage\-length=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmessage-length=n"
Try to format error messages so that they fit on lines of about
\&\fIn\fR characters.  If \fIn\fR is zero, then no line-wrapping is
done; each error message appears on a single line.  This is the
default for all front ends.
.Sp
Note \- this option also affects the display of the \fB#error\fR and
\&\fB#warning\fR pre-processor directives, and the \fBdeprecated\fR
function/type/variable attribute.  It does not however affect the
\&\fBpragma \s-1GCC\s0 warning\fR and \fBpragma \s-1GCC\s0 error\fR pragmas.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=once\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=once"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic messages
reporter to emit source location information \fIonce\fR; that is, in
case the message is too long to fit on a single physical line and has to
be wrapped, the source location won't be emitted (as prefix) again,
over and over, in subsequent continuation lines.  This is the default
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-location=every\-line\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-location=every-line"
Only meaningful in line-wrapping mode.  Instructs the diagnostic
messages reporter to emit the same source location information (as
prefix) for physical lines that result from the process of breaking
a message which is too long to fit on a single line.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-color[=\fR\fI\s-1WHEN\s0\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-color[=WHEN]"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-color\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-color"
.PD
Use color in diagnostics.  \fI\s-1WHEN\s0\fR is \fBnever\fR, \fBalways\fR,
or \fBauto\fR.  The default depends on how the compiler has been configured,
it can be any of the above \fI\s-1WHEN\s0\fR options or also \fBnever\fR
if \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR environment variable isn't present in the environment,
and \fBauto\fR otherwise.
\&\fBauto\fR means to use color only when the standard error is a terminal.
The forms \fB\-fdiagnostics\-color\fR and \fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-color\fR are
aliases for \fB\-fdiagnostics\-color=always\fR and
\&\fB\-fdiagnostics\-color=never\fR, respectively.
.Sp
The colors are defined by the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR.
Its value is a colon-separated list of capabilities and Select Graphic
Rendition (\s-1SGR\s0) substrings. \s-1SGR\s0 commands are interpreted by the
terminal or terminal emulator.  (See the section in the documentation
of your text terminal for permitted values and their meanings as
character attributes.)  These substring values are integers in decimal
representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.
Common values to concatenate include
\&\fB1\fR for bold,
\&\fB4\fR for underline,
\&\fB5\fR for blink,
\&\fB7\fR for inverse,
\&\fB39\fR for default foreground color,
\&\fB30\fR to \fB37\fR for foreground colors,
\&\fB90\fR to \fB97\fR for 16\-color mode foreground colors,
\&\fB38;5;0\fR to \fB38;5;255\fR
for 88\-color and 256\-color modes foreground colors,
\&\fB49\fR for default background color,
\&\fB40\fR to \fB47\fR for background colors,
\&\fB100\fR to \fB107\fR for 16\-color mode background colors,
and \fB48;5;0\fR to \fB48;5;255\fR
for 88\-color and 256\-color modes background colors.
.Sp
The default \fB\s-1GCC_COLORS\s0\fR is

.IP "\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-show-option"
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes text indicating the
command-line option that directly controls the diagnostic (if such an
option is known to the diagnostic machinery).  Specifying the
\&\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR flag suppresses that behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-caret\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-show-caret"
By default, each diagnostic emitted includes the original source line
and a caret \fB^\fR indicating the column.  This option suppresses this
information.  The source line is truncated to \fIn\fR characters, if
the \fB\-fmessage\-length=n\fR option is given.  When the output is done
to the terminal, the width is limited to the width given by the
\&\fB\s-1COLUMNS\s0\fR environment variable or, if not set, to the terminal width.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-labels\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-show-labels"
By default, when printing source code (via \fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-caret\fR),
diagnostics can label ranges of source code with pertinent information, such
as the types of expressions:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&            printf ("foo %s bar", long_i + long_j);
\&                         ~^       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\&                          |              |
\&                          char *         long int
.Ve
.Sp
This option suppresses the printing of these labels (in the example above,
the vertical bars and the \*(L"char *\*(R" and \*(L"long int\*(R" text).
.IP "\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-line\-numbers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-diagnostics-show-line-numbers"
By default, when printing source code (via \fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-caret\fR),
a left margin is printed, showing line numbers.  This option suppresses this
left margin.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-minimum\-margin\-width=\fR\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-minimum-margin-width=width"
This option controls the minimum width of the left margin printed by
\&\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-line\-numbers\fR.  It defaults to 6.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-parseable\-fixits\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-parseable-fixits"
Emit fix-it hints in a machine-parseable format, suitable for consumption
by IDEs.  For each fix-it, a line will be printed after the relevant
diagnostic, starting with the string \*(L"fix-it:\*(R".  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        fix\-it:"test.c":{45:3\-45:21}:"gtk_widget_show_all"
.Ve
.Sp
The location is expressed as a half-open range, expressed as a count of
bytes, starting at byte 1 for the initial column.  In the above example,
bytes 3 through 20 of line 45 of \*(L"test.c\*(R" are to be replaced with the
given string:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        00000000011111111112222222222
\&        12345678901234567890123456789
\&          gtk_widget_showall (dlg);
\&          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
\&          gtk_widget_show_all
.Ve
.Sp
The filename and replacement string escape backslash as \*(L"\e\e\*(R", tab as \*(L"\et\*(R",
newline as \*(L"\en\*(R", double quotes as \*(L"\e\*(R"\*(L", non-printable characters as octal
(e.g. vertical tab as \*(R"\e013").
.Sp
An empty replacement string indicates that the given range is to be removed.
An empty range (e.g. \*(L"45:3\-45:3\*(R") indicates that the string is to
be inserted at the given position.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-generate\-patch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-generate-patch"
Print fix-it hints to stderr in unified diff format, after any diagnostics
are printed.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        \-\-\- test.c
\&        +++ test.c
\&        @ \-42,5 +42,5 @
\&        
\&         void show_cb(GtkDialog *dlg)
\&         {
\&        \-  gtk_widget_showall(dlg);
\&        +  gtk_widget_show_all(dlg);
\&         }
.Ve
.Sp
The diff may or may not be colorized, following the same rules
as for diagnostics (see \fB\-fdiagnostics\-color\fR).
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-template\-tree\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-show-template-tree"
In the \*(C+ frontend, when printing diagnostics showing mismatching
template types, such as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&          could not convert \*(Aqstd::map<int, std::vector<double> >()\*(Aq
\&            from \*(Aqmap<[...],vector<double>>\*(Aq to \*(Aqmap<[...],vector<float>>
.Ve
.Sp
the \fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-template\-tree\fR flag enables printing a
tree-like structure showing the common and differing parts of the types,
such as:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&          map<
\&            [...],
\&            vector<
\&              [double != float]>>
.Ve
.Sp
The parts that differ are highlighted with color (\*(L"double\*(R" and
\&\*(L"float\*(R" in this case).
.IP "\fB\-fno\-elide\-type\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-elide-type"
By default when the \*(C+ frontend prints diagnostics showing mismatching
template types, common parts of the types are printed as \*(L"[...]\*(R" to
simplify the error message.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&          could not convert \*(Aqstd::map<int, std::vector<double> >()\*(Aq
\&            from \*(Aqmap<[...],vector<double>>\*(Aq to \*(Aqmap<[...],vector<float>>
.Ve
.Sp
Specifying the \fB\-fno\-elide\-type\fR flag suppresses that behavior.
This flag also affects the output of the
\&\fB\-fdiagnostics\-show\-template\-tree\fR flag.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-show\-column\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-show-column"
Do not print column numbers in diagnostics.  This may be necessary if
diagnostics are being scanned by a program that does not understand the
column numbers, such as \fBdejagnu\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdiagnostics\-format=\fR\fI\s-1FORMAT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdiagnostics-format=FORMAT"
Select a different format for printing diagnostics.
\&\fI\s-1FORMAT\s0\fR is \fBtext\fR or \fBjson\fR.
The default is \fBtext\fR.
.Sp
The \fBjson\fR format consists of a top-level \s-1JSON\s0 array containing \s-1JSON\s0
objects representing the diagnostics.
.Sp
The \s-1JSON\s0 is emitted as one line, without formatting; the examples below
have been formatted for clarity.
.Sp
Diagnostics can have child diagnostics.  For example, this error and note:

.SS "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
.IX Subsection "Options to Request or Suppress Warnings"
Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
.PP
The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\-fsyntax\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsyntax-only"
Check the code for syntax errors, but don't do anything beyond that.
.IP "\fB\-fmax\-errors=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmax-errors=n"
Limits the maximum number of error messages to \fIn\fR, at which point
\&\s-1GCC\s0 bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If \fIn\fR is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR is also
specified, then \fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR takes precedence over this
option.
.IP "\fB\-w\fR" 4
.IX Item "-w"
Inhibit all warning messages.
.IP "\fB\-Werror\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror"
Make all warnings into errors.
.IP "\fB\-Werror=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Werror="
Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example \fB\-Werror=switch\fR turns the warnings
controlled by \fB\-Wswitch\fR into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate \fB\-Werror\fR for specific
warnings; for example \fB\-Wno\-error=switch\fR makes
\&\fB\-Wswitch\fR warnings not be errors, even when \fB\-Werror\fR
is in effect.
.Sp
The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
\&\fB\-Werror=\fR and \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
\&\fB\-fno\-diagnostics\-show\-option\fR flag.)
.Sp
Note that specifying \fB\-Werror=\fR\fIfoo\fR automatically implies
\&\fB\-W\fR\fIfoo\fR.  However, \fB\-Wno\-error=\fR\fIfoo\fR does not
imply anything.
.IP "\fB\-Wfatal\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfatal-errors"
This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
.PP
You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
\&\fB\-W\fR, for example \fB\-Wimplicit\fR to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning \fB\-Wno\-\fR to turn off warnings; for
example, \fB\-Wno\-implicit\fR.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to \fB\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR and
\&\fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR.
.PP
Some options, such as \fB\-Wall\fR and \fB\-Wextra\fR, turn on other
options, such as \fB\-Wunused\fR, which may turn on further options,
such as \fB\-Wunused\-value\fR. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.
.PP
When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
\&\fB\-Wunknown\-warning\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the \fB\-Wno\-\fR form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for \fB\-Wno\-unknown\-warning\fR unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new \fB\-Wno\-\fR options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.

.PD
Issue all the warnings demanded by strict \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+. \s0 For \s-1ISO C,\s0 follows the
version of the \s-1ISO C\s0 standard specified by any \fB\-std\fR option used.
.Sp
Valid \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require \fB\-ansi\fR or a
\&\fB\-std\fR option specifying the required version of \s-1ISO C\s0).  However,
without this option, certain \s-1GNU\s0 extensions and traditional C and \*(C+
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with \fB_\|_\fR.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_extension_\|_\*(C'\fR.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
.Sp
Some users try to use \fB\-Wpedantic\fR to check programs for strict \s-1ISO
C\s0 conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all\-\-\-only those for which
\&\s-1ISO C \s0\fIrequires\fR a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
.Sp
A feature to report any failure to conform to \s-1ISO C\s0 might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR.  We don't have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
.Sp
Where the standard specified with \fB\-std\fR represents a \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect of C, such as \fBgnu90\fR or \fBgnu99\fR, there is a
corresponding \fIbase standard\fR, the version of \s-1ISO C\s0 on which the \s-1GNU\s0
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from \fB\-Wpedantic\fR are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified \s-1GNU
C\s0 dialect, since by definition the \s-1GNU\s0 dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
.IP "\fB\-pedantic\-errors\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pedantic-errors"
Give an error whenever the \fIbase standard\fR (see \fB\-Wpedantic\fR)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to \fB\-Werror=pedantic\fR, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.
.IP "\fB\-Wall\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wall"
This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in \fB\*(C+ Dialect
Options\fR and \fBObjective-C and Objective\-\*(C+ Dialect Options\fR.

Give a warning when a value of type \f(CW\*(C`float\*(C'\fR is implicitly

It is easy to accidentally do computations with \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR because

.PD
Level \fI1\fR of \fB\-Wformat\-overflow\fR enabled by \fB\-Wformat\fR
employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer.  At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
is bounded either by their directive's precision or by a finite set of
string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
results in the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to \f(CW\*(C`sprintf\*(C'\fR
below is diagnosed because even with both \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR equal to zero,
the terminating \s-1NUL\s0 character (\f(CW\*(Aq\e0\*(Aq\fR) appended by the function
to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing
the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the
warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.

.IP "\fB\-Wformat\-overflow=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wformat-overflow=2"
Level \fI2\fR warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level
\&\fI2\fR, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose
length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive's precision,
or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character
array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.
.Sp
At level \fI2\fR, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but
this time because with \fIa\fR equal to a 32\-bit \f(CW\*(C`INT_MIN\*(C'\fR the first
\&\f(CW%i\fR directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of
the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values
of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased
to at least 34 bytes.  \s-1GCC\s0 includes the minimum size of the buffer in
an informational note following the warning.
.Sp
An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to
constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string
arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the format
directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed
to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce
the required buffer size.  For example, if \fIa\fR and \fIb\fR in the
example above can be assumed to be within the precision of
the \f(CW\*(C`short int\*(C'\fR type then using either the \f(CW%hi\fR format
directive or casting the argument to \f(CW\*(C`short\*(C'\fR reduces the maximum
required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.

This option diagnoses those cases where a new function or a new file is added
to the user code between compiling with \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR and with
\&\fB\-fprofile\-use\fR, without regenerating the profiles.  In these cases, the
profile feedback data files do not contain any profile feedback information for
the newly added function or file respectively.  Also, in the case when profile
count data (.gcda) files are removed, \s-1GCC\s0 cannot use any profile feedback
information.  In all these cases, warnings are issued to inform the user that a
profile generation step is due.  \fB\-Wno\-missing\-profile\fR can be used to

.IP "\fB\-Wparentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wparentheses"
Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
.Sp
Also warn if a comparison like \f(CW\*(C`x<=y<=z\*(C'\fR appears; this is
equivalent to \f(CW\*(C`(x<=y ? 1 : 0) <= z\*(C'\fR, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
.Sp
Also warn for dangerous uses of the \s-1GNU\s0 extension to
\&\f(CW\*(C`?:\*(C'\fR with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the \f(CW\*(C`?\*(C'\fR: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
.Sp
For \*(C+ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in
declarations, which can indicate an attempt at a function call instead
of a declaration:
.Sp
.Vb 5

.IP "\fB\-Wsequence\-point\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsequence-point"
Warn about code that may have undefined semantics because of violations
of sequence point rules in the C and \*(C+ standards.
.Sp
The C and \*(C+ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/\*(C+
program are evaluated in terms of \fIsequence points\fR, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
\&\f(CW\*(C`&&\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`||\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`? :\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`,\*(C'\fR (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
.Sp
It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and \*(C+ standards specify that \*(L"Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.\*(R".  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
.Sp
Examples of code with undefined behavior are \f(CW\*(C`a = a++;\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`a[n]
= b[n++]\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`a[i++] = i;\*(C'\fR.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
.Sp
The \*(C+17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in
more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the above
examples are no longer undefined.  But this warning will still warn
about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C
and earlier revisions of \*(C+.
.Sp
The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.
Links to discussions of the problem, including proposed formal
definitions, may be found on the \s-1GCC\s0 readings page, at
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/readings.html\fR>.

Warn whenever a function is defined with a return type that defaults

return value in a function whose return type is not \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR
(falling off the end of the function body is considered returning
without a value).
.Sp
For C only, warn about a \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR statement with an expression in a
function whose return type is \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR, unless the expression type is
also \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR.  As a \s-1GNU\s0 extension, the latter case is accepted
without a warning unless \fB\-Wpedantic\fR is used.  Attempting
to use the return value of a non\-\f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR function other than \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR
that flows off the end by reaching the closing curly brace that terminates
the function is undefined.
.Sp
Unlike in C, in \*(C+, flowing off the end of a non\-\f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR function other
than \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR results in undefined behavior even when the value of
the function is not used.

Warn whenever a statement computes a result that is explicitly not

side of a comma expression that contains no side effects. For example,
an expression such as \f(CW\*(C`x[i,j]\*(C'\fR causes a warning, while

.IX Item "-Wuninitialized"
Warn if an automatic variable is used without first being initialized
or if a variable may be clobbered by a \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR call. In \*(C+,
warn if a non-static reference or non-static \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fR member
appears in a class without constructors.
.Sp
If you want to warn about code that uses the uninitialized value of the
variable in its own initializer, use the \fB\-Winit\-self\fR option.
.Sp
These warnings occur for individual uninitialized or clobbered
elements of structure, union or array variables as well as for
variables that are uninitialized or clobbered as a whole.  They do
not occur for variables or elements declared \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR.  Because
these warnings depend on optimization, the exact variables or elements
for which there are warnings depends on the precise optimization
options and version of \s-1GCC\s0 used.
.Sp
Note that there may be no warning about a variable that is used only
to compute a value that itself is never used, because such
computations may be deleted by data flow analysis before the warnings
are printed.
.IP "\fB\-Winvalid\-memory\-model\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winvalid-memory-model"
Warn for invocations of \fB_\|_atomic Builtins\fR, \fB_\|_sync Builtins\fR,
and the C11 atomic generic functions with a memory consistency argument
that is either invalid for the operation or outside the range of values
of the \f(CW\*(C`memory_order\*(C'\fR enumeration.  For example, since the
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_atomic_store\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_atomic_store_n\*(C'\fR built-ins are only
defined for the relaxed, release, and sequentially consistent memory

.IP "\fB\-Wmaybe\-uninitialized\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmaybe-uninitialized"
For an automatic (i.e. local) variable, if there exists a path from the
function entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time.
.Sp
These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise
\&\s-1GCC\s0 does not keep track of the state of variables.
.Sp
These warnings are made optional because \s-1GCC\s0 may not be able to determine when
the code is correct in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one
example of how this can happen:
.Sp
.Vb 12
\&        {
\&          int x;
\&          switch (y)
\&            {

\&            case 3: x = 5;
\&            }
\&          foo (x);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If the value of \f(CW\*(C`y\*(C'\fR is always 1, 2 or 3, then \f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is
always initialized, but \s-1GCC\s0 doesn't know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with \fIassert\fR\|(0) or
similar code.
.Sp
This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR.
The compiler sees only the calls to \f(CW\*(C`setjmp\*(C'\fR.  It cannot know
where \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
.Sp
Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR.

.IX Item "-Wno-prio-ctor-dtor"
Do not warn if a priority from 0 to 100 is used for constructor or destructor.
The use of constructor and destructor attributes allow you to assign a
priority to the constructor/destructor to control its order of execution
before \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR is called or after it returns.  The priority values must be
greater than 100 as the compiler reserves priority values between 0\-\-100 for
the implementation.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4

This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the

.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-aliasing=n"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR is active.
It warns about code that might break the strict aliasing rules that the
compiler is using for optimization.
Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).
Higher levels also correspond to more effort, similar to the way \fB\-O\fR 
works.
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR is equivalent to \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing=3\fR.
.Sp
Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but \fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
.Sp
Level 3 (default for \fB\-Wstrict\-aliasing\fR):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
\&\f(CW\*(C`*(int*)&some_float\*(C'\fR.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=n"
.PD
This option is only active when signed overflow is undefined.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
.Sp
An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=1\fR" 4

Warn about cases that are both questionable and easy to avoid.  For

are not, and must be explicitly requested.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=2"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified to a
constant.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`abs (x) >= 0\*(C'\fR.  This can only be
simplified when signed integer overflow is undefined, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`abs (INT_MIN)\*(C'\fR overflows to \f(CW\*(C`INT_MIN\*(C'\fR, which is less than
zero.  \fB\-Wstrict\-overflow\fR (with no level) is the same as
\&\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=2\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=3"
Also warn about other cases where a comparison is simplified.  For
example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 > 1\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x > 0\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=4\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=4"
Also warn about other simplifications not covered by the above cases.
For example: \f(CW\*(C`(x * 10) / 5\*(C'\fR is simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x * 2\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-overflow=5\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-overflow=5"
Also warn about cases where the compiler reduces the magnitude of a
constant involved in a comparison.  For example: \f(CW\*(C`x + 2 > y\*(C'\fR is
simplified to \f(CW\*(C`x + 1 >= y\*(C'\fR.  This is reported only at the
highest warning level because this simplification applies to many
comparisons, so this warning level gives a very large number of
false positives.

\&\f(CW\*(C`strcpy\*(C'\fR that are determined to overflow the destination buffer.  The
optional argument is one greater than the type of Object Size Checking to
perform to determine the size of the destination.  
The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays
but not for raw memory functions like \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR which always make use
of Object Size type\-0.  The option also warns for calls that specify a size
in excess of the largest possible object or at most \f(CW\*(C`SIZE_MAX / 2\*(C'\fR bytes.
The option produces the best results with optimization enabled but can detect
a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization in
calls to the \s-1GCC\s0 built-in functions like \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_memcpy\*(C'\fR that
correspond to the standard functions.  In any case, the option warns about
just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow
checking built-ins.  For example, the option will issue a warning for
the \f(CW\*(C`strcpy\*(C'\fR call below because it copies at least 5 characters
(the string \f(CW"blue"\fR including the terminating \s-1NUL\s0) into the buffer
of size 4.

The \fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=1\fR option uses type-zero Object Size Checking
to determine the sizes of destination objects.  This is the default setting
of the option.  At this setting the option will not warn for writes past
the end of subobjects of larger objects accessed by pointers unless the
size of the largest surrounding object is known.  When the destination may
be one of several objects it is assumed to be the largest one of them.  On
Linux systems, when optimization is enabled at this setting the option warns
for the same code as when the \f(CW\*(C`_FORTIFY_SOURCE\*(C'\fR macro is defined to
a non-zero value.
.IP "\fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=2\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstringop-overflow=2"
The \fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=2\fR option uses type-one Object Size Checking
to determine the sizes of destination objects.  At this setting the option
will warn about overflows when writing to members of the largest complete
objects whose exact size is known.  It will, however, not warn for excessive
writes to the same members of unknown objects referenced by pointers since
they may point to arrays containing unknown numbers of elements.
.IP "\fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=3\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstringop-overflow=3"
The \fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=3\fR option uses type-two Object Size Checking

warns about overflowing the smallest object or data member.  This is the
most restrictive setting of the option that may result in warnings for safe
code.
.IP "\fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=4\fR" 4

The \fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=4\fR option uses type-three Object Size Checking

will warn about overflowing any data members, and when the destination is
one of several objects it uses the size of the largest of them to decide
whether to issue a warning.  Similarly to \fB\-Wstringop\-overflow=3\fR this
setting of the option may result in warnings for benign code.

Warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions such as \f(CW\*(C`strncat\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`strncpy\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`stpncpy\*(C'\fR that may either truncate the copied string
or leave the destination unchanged.
.Sp
In the following example, the call to \f(CW\*(C`strncat\*(C'\fR specifies a bound that
is less than the length of the source string.  As a result, the copy of
the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.  To avoid the
warning use \f(CW\*(C`bufsize \- strlen (buf) \- 1)\*(C'\fR as the bound.
.Sp
.Vb 4

.Ve
.Sp
As another example, the following call to \f(CW\*(C`strncpy\*(C'\fR results in copying
to \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR just the characters preceding the terminating \s-1NUL,\s0 without
appending the \s-1NUL\s0 to the end.  Assuming the result of \f(CW\*(C`strncpy\*(C'\fR is
necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call
is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
NUL-terminated, call \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR instead.
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        void copy (char *d, const char *s)

.Ve
.Sp
In the following example, the call to \f(CW\*(C`strncpy\*(C'\fR specifies the size
of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length of the source
string is equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will
not be NUL-terminated.  Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid
the warning, specify \f(CW\*(C`sizeof buf \- 1\*(C'\fR as the bound and set the last
element of the buffer to \f(CW\*(C`NUL\*(C'\fR.

In situations where a character array is intended to store a sequence
of bytes with no terminating \f(CW\*(C`NUL\*(C'\fR such an array may be annotated
with attribute \f(CW\*(C`nonstring\*(C'\fR to avoid this warning.  Such arrays,
however, are not suitable arguments to functions that expect
\&\f(CW\*(C`NUL\*(C'\fR\-terminated strings.  To help detect accidental misuses of
such arrays \s-1GCC\s0 issues warnings unless it can prove that the use is

Warn about function pointers that might be candidates for \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR
attributes.  Note these are only possible candidates, not absolute ones.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 guesses that function pointers with \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes that
are used in assignment, initialization, parameter passing or return

\&\s-1GCC\s0 also warns about function definitions that might be
candidates for \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR attributes.  Again, these are only

\&\f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`realloc\*(C'\fR.  Because the behavior of these functions
when called with a zero size differs among implementations (and in the case
of \f(CW\*(C`realloc\*(C'\fR has been deprecated) relying on it may result in subtle
portability bugs and should be avoided.
.IP "\fB\-Walloc\-size\-larger\-than=\fR\fIbyte-size\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-Walloca\-larger\-than=\fR\fIbyte-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Walloca-larger-than=byte-size"
This option warns on calls to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR with an integer argument whose
value is either zero, or that is not bounded by a controlling predicate
that limits its value to at most \fIbyte-size\fR.  It also warns for calls
to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR where the bound value is unknown.  Arguments of non-integer
types are considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to
the expected range.
.Sp
For example, a bounded case of \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR could be:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        void func (size_t n)
\&        {
\&          void *p;
\&          if (n <= 1000)
\&            p = alloca (n);
\&          else
\&            p = malloc (n);
\&          f (p);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In the above example, passing \f(CW\*(C`\-Walloca\-larger\-than=1000\*(C'\fR would not
issue a warning because the call to \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR is known to be at most
1000 bytes.  However, if \f(CW\*(C`\-Walloca\-larger\-than=500\*(C'\fR were passed,
the compiler would emit a warning.
.Sp
Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR with no
controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        void func ()
\&        {
\&          void *p = alloca (n);
\&          f (p);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If \f(CW\*(C`\-Walloca\-larger\-than=500\*(C'\fR were passed, the above would trigger
a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds checking.
.Sp
Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could
cause a warning:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        void func (signed int n)
\&        {
\&          if (n < 500)
\&            {
\&              p = alloca (n);
\&              f (p);
\&            }
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In the above example, \fIn\fR could be negative, causing a larger than
expected argument to be implicitly cast into the \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR call.
.Sp
This option also warns when \f(CW\*(C`alloca\*(C'\fR is used in a loop.

programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that's a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
\&\s-1ISO C. \s0 Also warn about \s-1ISO C\s0 constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in \s-1ISO C\s0 it does not.
.IP "*" 4
In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the \fB#\fR appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
\&\fB\-Wtraditional\fR warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the \fB#\fR does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize \f(CW\*(C`#elif\*(C'\fR, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.
.IP "*" 4
A function-like macro that appears without arguments.
.IP "*" 4
The unary plus operator.
.IP "*" 4
The \fBU\fR integer constant suffix, or the \fBF\fR or \fBL\fR floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the \fBL\fR suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the \fB_MIN\fR/\fB_MAX\fR macros in \f(CW\*(C`<limits.h>\*(C'\fR.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however \s-1GCC\s0's integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.
.IP "*" 4
A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.
.IP "*" 4
A \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement has an operand of type \f(CW\*(C`long\*(C'\fR.
.IP "*" 4
A non\-\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR function declaration follows a \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.
.IP "*" 4
The \s-1ISO\s0 type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.
.IP "*" 4
Usage of \s-1ISO\s0 string concatenation is detected.
.IP "*" 4
Initialization of automatic aggregates.
.IP "*" 4
Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.
.IP "*" 4
Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. \f(CW\*(C`_\|_STDC_\|_\*(C'\fR to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.
.IP "*" 4
Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating\-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use \fB\-Wtraditional\-conversion\fR.
.IP "*" 4
Use of \s-1ISO C\s0 style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
\&\fInot\fR issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these \s-1ISO C\s0 features appear in your code when using
libiberty's traditional C compatibility macros, \f(CW\*(C`PARAMS\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`VPARAMS\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a \s-1GCC\s0 extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fB\-Wtraditional\-conversion\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wtraditional-conversion (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a prototype causes a type conversion that is different from what
would happen to the same argument in the absence of a prototype.  This
includes conversions of fixed point to floating and vice versa, and
conversions changing the width or signedness of a fixed-point argument
except when the same as the default promotion.
.IP "\fB\-Wdeclaration\-after\-statement\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdeclaration-after-statement (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn when a declaration is found after a statement in a block.  This
construct, known from \*(C+, was introduced with \s-1ISO C99\s0 and is by default
allowed in \s-1GCC. \s0 It is not supported by \s-1ISO C90.  \s0
.IP "\fB\-Wshadow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshadow"
Warn whenever a local variable or type declaration shadows another
variable, parameter, type, class member (in \*(C+), or instance variable
(in Objective-C) or whenever a built-in function is shadowed. Note
that in \*(C+, the compiler warns if a local variable shadows an
explicit typedef, but not if it shadows a struct/class/enum.
Same as \fB\-Wshadow=global\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-shadow\-ivar\fR (Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-shadow-ivar (Objective-C only)"
Do not warn whenever a local variable shadows an instance variable in an
Objective-C method.
.IP "\fB\-Wshadow=global\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshadow=global"
The default for \fB\-Wshadow\fR. Warns for any (global) shadowing.
.IP "\fB\-Wshadow=local\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshadow=local"
Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter.
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wshadow=global\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wshadow=compatible\-local\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wshadow=compatible-local"
Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter
whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable. In \*(C+,
type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
converted to that of the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag
(in addition to \fB\-Wshadow=local\fR) is based on the idea that when
a local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&        for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
\&        {
\&          for (int i = 0; i < N; ++i)
\&          {
\&            ...
\&          }
\&          ...
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Since the two variable \f(CW\*(C`i\*(C'\fR in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only \fB\-Wshadow=compatible\-local\fR will not emit a warning.
Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one
in place of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error or
warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case will not lead to
undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of \fB\-Wshadow=local\fR can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wshadow=local\fR.

\&\s-1GCC\s0 allows as extensions for compatibility with legacy code.  For example,
the following \f(CW\*(C`new\*(C'\fR expression is not diagnosed at this level even

With \fB\-Wcatch\-value=1\fR (or \fB\-Wcatch\-value\fR for short)
warn about polymorphic class types that are caught by value.
With \fB\-Wcatch\-value=2\fR warn about all class types that are caught
by value. With \fB\-Wcatch\-value=3\fR warn about all types that are
not caught by reference. \fB\-Wcatch\-value\fR is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wclobbered\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wclobbered"
Warn for variables that might be changed by \f(CW\*(C`longjmp\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`vfork\*(C'\fR.  This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wconditionally\-supported\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wconditionally-supported ( and Objective- only)"
Warn for conditionally-supported (\*(C+11 [intro.defs]) constructs.
.IP "\fB\-Wconversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wconversion"
Warn for implicit conversions that may alter a value. This includes
conversions between real and integer, like \f(CW\*(C`abs (x)\*(C'\fR when
\&\f(CW\*(C`x\*(C'\fR is \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR; conversions between signed and unsigned,
like \f(CW\*(C`unsigned ui = \-1\*(C'\fR; and conversions to smaller types, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`sqrtf (M_PI)\*(C'\fR. Do not warn for explicit casts like \f(CW\*(C`abs
((int) x)\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`ui = (unsigned) \-1\*(C'\fR, or if the value is not
changed by the conversion like in \f(CW\*(C`abs (2.0)\*(C'\fR.  Warnings about
conversions between signed and unsigned integers can be disabled by
using \fB\-Wno\-sign\-conversion\fR.
.Sp
For \*(C+, also warn for confusing overload resolution for user-defined
conversions; and conversions that never use a type conversion
operator: conversions to \f(CW\*(C`void\*(C'\fR, the same type, a base class or a
reference to them. Warnings about conversions between signed and
unsigned integers are disabled by default in \*(C+ unless
\&\fB\-Wsign\-conversion\fR is explicitly enabled.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-conversion\-null\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-conversion-null ( and Objective- only)"
Do not warn for conversions between \f(CW\*(C`NULL\*(C'\fR and non-pointer
types. \fB\-Wconversion\-null\fR is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wzero\-as\-null\-pointer\-constant\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when a literal \fB0\fR is used as null pointer constant.  This can
be useful to facilitate the conversion to \f(CW\*(C`nullptr\*(C'\fR in \*(C+11.
.IP "\fB\-Wsubobject\-linkage\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsubobject-linkage ( and Objective- only)"
Warn if a class type has a base or a field whose type uses the anonymous
namespace or depends on a type with no linkage.  If a type A depends on
a type B with no or internal linkage, defining it in multiple
translation units would be an \s-1ODR\s0 violation because the meaning of B
is different in each translation unit.  If A only appears in a single
translation unit, the best way to silence the warning is to give it
internal linkage by putting it in an anonymous namespace as well.  The
compiler doesn't give this warning for types defined in the main .C
file, as those are unlikely to have multiple definitions.
\&\fB\-Wsubobject\-linkage\fR is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wdangling\-else\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdangling-else"
Warn about constructions where there may be confusion to which
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement an \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs.  Here is an example of
such a case:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            if (b)
\&              foo ();
\&          else
\&            bar ();
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
In C/\*(C+, every \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR branch belongs to the innermost possible
\&\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement, which in this example is \f(CW\*(C`if (b)\*(C'\fR.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, \s-1GCC\s0 issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement so there is no way the \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR
can belong to the enclosing \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.  The resulting code
looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&        {
\&          if (a)
\&            {
\&              if (b)
\&                foo ();
\&              else
\&                bar ();

\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wparentheses\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wdate\-time\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdate-time"
Warn when macros \f(CW\*(C`_\|_TIME_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DATE_\|_\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_TIMESTAMP_\|_\*(C'\fR
are encountered as they might prevent bit-wise-identical reproducible
compilations.
.IP "\fB\-Wdelete\-incomplete\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wdelete-incomplete ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when deleting a pointer to incomplete type, which may cause
undefined behavior at runtime.  This warning is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wuseless\-cast\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wuseless-cast ( and Objective- only)"
Warn when an expression is casted to its own type.
.IP "\fB\-Wempty\-body\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wempty-body"
Warn if an empty body occurs in an \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`do
while\*(C'\fR statement.  This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wenum\-compare\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wenum-compare"
Warn about a comparison between values of different enumerated types.
In \*(C+ enumerated type mismatches in conditional expressions are also
diagnosed and the warning is enabled by default.  In C this warning is 
enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wextra\-semi\fR (\*(C+, Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wextra-semi (, Objective- only)"
Warn about redundant semicolon after in-class function definition.
.IP "\fB\-Wjump\-misses\-init\fR (C, Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wjump-misses-init (C, Objective-C only)"
Warn if a \f(CW\*(C`goto\*(C'\fR statement or a \f(CW\*(C`switch\*(C'\fR statement jumps
forward across the initialization of a variable, or jumps backward to a
label after the variable has been initialized.  This only warns about
variables that are initialized when they are declared.  This warning is
only supported for C and Objective-C; in \*(C+ this sort of branch is an
error in any case.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wjump\-misses\-init\fR is included in \fB\-Wc++\-compat\fR.  It
can be disabled with the \fB\-Wno\-jump\-misses\-init\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-compare\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-compare"
Warn when a comparison between signed and unsigned values could produce
an incorrect result when the signed value is converted to unsigned.
In \*(C+, this warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.  In C, it is
also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsign\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsign-conversion"
Warn for implicit conversions that may change the sign of an integer
value, like assigning a signed integer expression to an unsigned
integer variable. An explicit cast silences the warning. In C, this
option is enabled also by \fB\-Wconversion\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wfloat\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wfloat-conversion"
Warn for implicit conversions that reduce the precision of a real value.
This includes conversions from real to integer, and from higher precision
real to lower precision real values.  This option is also enabled by
\&\fB\-Wconversion\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-scalar\-storage\-order\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-scalar-storage-order"
Do not warn on suspicious constructs involving reverse scalar storage order.
.IP "\fB\-Wsized\-deallocation\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wsized-deallocation ( and Objective- only)"
Warn about a definition of an unsized deallocation function
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        void operator delete (void *) noexcept;
\&        void operator delete[] (void *) noexcept;
.Ve
.Sp
without a definition of the corresponding sized deallocation function
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        void operator delete (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
\&        void operator delete[] (void *, std::size_t) noexcept;
.Ve
.Sp
or vice versa.  Enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR along with
\&\fB\-fsized\-deallocation\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsizeof\-pointer\-div\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsizeof-pointer-div"
Warn for suspicious divisions of two sizeof expressions that divide
the pointer size by the element size, which is the usual way to compute
the array size but won't work out correctly with pointers.  This warning
warns e.g. about \f(CW\*(C`sizeof (ptr) / sizeof (ptr[0])\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`ptr\*(C'\fR is
not an array, but a pointer.  This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsizeof\-pointer\-memaccess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsizeof-pointer-memaccess"
Warn for suspicious length parameters to certain string and memory built-in
functions if the argument uses \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR.  This warning triggers for
example for \f(CW\*(C`memset (ptr, 0, sizeof (ptr));\*(C'\fR if \f(CW\*(C`ptr\*(C'\fR is not
an array, but a pointer, and suggests a possible fix, or about
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy (&foo, ptr, sizeof (&foo));\*(C'\fR.  \fB\-Wsizeof\-pointer\-memaccess\fR
also warns about calls to bounded string copy functions like \f(CW\*(C`strncat\*(C'\fR
or \f(CW\*(C`strncpy\*(C'\fR that specify as the bound a \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR expression of
the source array.  For example, in the following function the call to
\&\f(CW\*(C`strncat\*(C'\fR specifies the size of the source string as the bound.  That
is almost certainly a mistake and so the call is diagnosed.
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        void make_file (const char *name)
\&        {
\&          char path[PATH_MAX];
\&          strncpy (path, name, sizeof path \- 1);

.Ve
.Sp
The \fB\-Wsizeof\-pointer\-memaccess\fR option is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wsizeof\-array\-argument\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wsizeof-array-argument"
Warn when the \f(CW\*(C`sizeof\*(C'\fR operator is applied to a parameter that is
declared as an array in a function definition.  This warning is enabled by
default for C and \*(C+ programs.
.IP "\fB\-Wmemset\-elt\-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmemset-elt-size"
Warn for suspicious calls to the \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR built-in function, if the
first argument references an array, and the third argument is a number
equal to the number of elements, but not equal to the size of the array
in memory.  This indicates that the user has omitted a multiplication by
the element size.  This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmemset\-transposed\-args\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmemset-transposed-args"
Warn for suspicious calls to the \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR built-in function where
the second argument is not zero and the third argument is zero.  For
example, the call \f(CW\*(C`memset (buf, sizeof buf, 0)\*(C'\fR is diagnosed because
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset (buf, 0, sizeof buf)\*(C'\fR was meant instead.  The diagnostic
is only emitted if the third argument is a literal zero.  Otherwise, if
it is an expression that is folded to zero, or a cast of zero to some
type, it is far less likely that the arguments have been mistakenly
transposed and no warning is emitted.  This warning is enabled
by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waddress\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waddress"
Warn about suspicious uses of memory addresses. These include using
the address of a function in a conditional expression, such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`void func(void); if (func)\*(C'\fR, and comparisons against the memory
address of a string literal, such as \f(CW\*(C`if (x == "abc")\*(C'\fR.  Such
uses typically indicate a programmer error: the address of a function
always evaluates to true, so their use in a conditional usually
indicate that the programmer forgot the parentheses in a function
call; and comparisons against string literals result in unspecified
behavior and are not portable in C, so they usually indicate that the
programmer intended to use \f(CW\*(C`strcmp\*(C'\fR.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waddress\-of\-packed\-member\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waddress-of-packed-member"
Warn when the address of packed member of struct or union is taken,
which usually results in an unaligned pointer value.  This is
enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wlogical\-op\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlogical-op"
Warn about suspicious uses of logical operators in expressions.
This includes using logical operators in contexts where a
bit-wise operator is likely to be expected.  Also warns when
the operands of a logical operator are the same:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        extern int a;
\&        if (a < 0 && a < 0) { ... }
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wlogical\-not\-parentheses\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wlogical-not-parentheses"
Warn about logical not used on the left hand side operand of a comparison.
This option does not warn if the right operand is considered to be a boolean
expression.  Its purpose is to detect suspicious code like the following:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        int a;
\&        ...
\&        if (!a > 1) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
It is possible to suppress the warning by wrapping the \s-1LHS\s0 into
parentheses:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        if ((!a) > 1) { ... }
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Waggregate\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Waggregate-return"
Warn if any functions that return structures or unions are defined or
called.  (In languages where you can return an array, this also elicits
a warning.)
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-aggressive\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-aggressive-loop-optimizations"
Warn if in a loop with constant number of iterations the compiler detects
undefined behavior in some statement during one or more of the iterations.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-attributes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-attributes"
Do not warn if an unexpected \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_\*(C'\fR is used, such as
unrecognized attributes, function attributes applied to variables,
etc.  This does not stop errors for incorrect use of supported
attributes.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-builtin\-declaration\-mismatch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-builtin-declaration-mismatch"
Warn if a built-in function is declared with an incompatible signature
or as a non-function, or when a built-in function declared with a type
that does not include a prototype is called with arguments whose promoted
types do not match those expected by the function.  When \fB\-Wextra\fR
is specified, also warn when a built-in function that takes arguments is
declared without a prototype.  The \fB\-Wno\-builtin\-declaration\-mismatch\fR
warning is enabled by default.  To avoid the warning include the appropriate
header to bring the prototypes of built-in functions into scope.
.Sp
For example, the call to \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR below is diagnosed by the warning
because the function expects a value of type \f(CW\*(C`size_t\*(C'\fR as its argument
but the type of \f(CW32\fR is \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR.  With \fB\-Wextra\fR,
the declaration of the function is diagnosed as well.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&        extern void* memset ();
\&        void f (void *d)
\&        {
\&          memset (d, \*(Aq\e0\*(Aq, 32);
\&        }
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-builtin\-macro\-redefined\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-builtin-macro-redefined"
Do not warn if certain built-in macros are redefined.  This suppresses
warnings for redefinition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_TIMESTAMP_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_TIME_\|_\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_DATE_\|_\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FILE_\|_\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_BASE_FILE_\|_\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstrict\-prototypes\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wstrict-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a function is declared or defined without specifying the
argument types.  (An old-style function definition is permitted without
a warning if preceded by a declaration that specifies the argument
types.)
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-declaration\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-declaration (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn for obsolescent usages, according to the C Standard, in a
declaration. For example, warn if storage-class specifiers like
\&\f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR are not the first things in a declaration.  This warning
is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wold\-style\-definition\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wold-style-definition (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if an old-style function definition is used.  A warning is given
even if there is a previous prototype.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-parameter\-type\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-parameter-type (C and Objective-C only)"
A function parameter is declared without a type specifier in K&R\-style
functions:
.Sp
.Vb 1

.Ve
.Sp
This warning is also enabled by \fB\-Wextra\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-prototypes\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-prototypes (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype
declaration.  This warning is issued even if the definition itself
provides a prototype.  Use this option to detect global functions
that do not have a matching prototype declaration in a header file.
This option is not valid for \*(C+ because all function declarations
provide prototypes and a non-matching declaration declares an
overload rather than conflict with an earlier declaration.
Use \fB\-Wmissing\-declarations\fR to detect missing declarations in \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-declarations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-declarations"
Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration.
Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype.
Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in
header files.  In C, no warnings are issued for functions with previous
non-prototype declarations; use \fB\-Wmissing\-prototypes\fR to detect
missing prototypes.  In \*(C+, no warnings are issued for function templates,
or for inline functions, or for functions in anonymous namespaces.
.IP "\fB\-Wmissing\-field\-initializers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wmissing-field-initializers"
Warn if a structure's initializer has some fields missing.  For
example, the following code causes such a warning, because
\&\f(CW\*(C`x.h\*(C'\fR is implicitly zero:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { 3, 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
This option does not warn about designated initializers, so the following
modification does not trigger a warning:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { .f = 3, .g = 4 };
.Ve
.Sp
In C this option does not warn about the universal zero initializer
\&\fB{ 0 }\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        struct s x = { 0 };
.Ve
.Sp
Likewise, in \*(C+ this option does not warn about the empty { }
initializer, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        struct s { int f, g, h; };
\&        s x = { };
.Ve
.Sp
This warning is included in \fB\-Wextra\fR.  To get other \fB\-Wextra\fR
warnings without this one, use \fB\-Wextra \-Wno\-missing\-field\-initializers\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-multichar\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-multichar"
Do not warn if a multicharacter constant (\fB'\s-1FOOF\s0'\fR) is used.
Usually they indicate a typo in the user's code, as they have
implementation-defined values, and should not be used in portable code.
.IP "\fB\-Wnormalized=\fR[\fBnone\fR|\fBid\fR|\fBnfc\fR|\fBnfkc\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-Wnormalized=[none|id|nfc|nfkc]"
In \s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+,\s0 two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic \s-1ASCII\s0 character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the \s-1ISO 10646\s0 standard sets out some \fInormalization rules\fR which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  \s-1GCC\s0 can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
.Sp
There are four levels of warning supported by \s-1GCC. \s0 The default is
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfc\fR, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the \s-1ISO 10646 \*(L"C\*(R"\s0 normalized form, \fI\s-1NFC\s0\fR.  \s-1NFC\s0 is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
\&\fB\-Wnormalized\fR.
.Sp
Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 and \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 that, when turned into \s-1NFC,\s0 are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there's no way to use these symbols in portable
\&\s-1ISO C\s0 or \*(C+ and have all your identifiers in \s-1NFC.
\&\s0\fB\-Wnormalized=id\fR suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
.Sp
You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=none\fR or \fB\-Wno\-normalized\fR.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
\&\*(L"D\*(R"), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.
.Sp
Some characters in \s-1ISO 10646\s0 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance \f(CW\*(C`\eu207F\*(C'\fR, \*(L"\s-1SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N\*(R",\s0 displays just like a regular \f(CW\*(C`n\*(C'\fR that has been
placed in a superscript.  \s-1ISO 10646\s0 defines the \fI\s-1NFKC\s0\fR
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and \s-1GCC\s0 warns if your code is not in \s-1NFKC\s0 if you use
\&\fB\-Wnormalized=nfkc\fR.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-attribute\-warning\fR" 4

Such structures may be mis-aligned for little benefit.  For
instance, in this code, the variable \f(CW\*(C`f.x\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR
is misaligned even though \f(CW\*(C`struct bar\*(C'\fR does not itself
have the packed attribute:

The 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 series of \s-1GCC\s0 ignore the \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute
on bit-fields of type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR.  This has been fixed in \s-1GCC 4.4\s0 but
the change can lead to differences in the structure layout.  \s-1GCC\s0

.IX Item "-Wpacked-not-aligned (C, , Objective-C and Objective- only)"
Warn if a structure field with explicitly specified alignment in a

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wpadded\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wpadded"
Warn if padding is included in a structure, either to align an element
of the structure or to align the whole structure.  Sometimes when this
happens it is possible to rearrange the fields of the structure to
reduce the padding and so make the structure smaller.
.IP "\fB\-Wredundant\-decls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wredundant-decls"
Warn if anything is declared more than once in the same scope, even in
cases where multiple declaration is valid and changes nothing.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-restrict\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-restrict"
Warn when an object referenced by a \f(CW\*(C`restrict\*(C'\fR\-qualified parameter
(or, in \*(C+, a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_restrict\*(C'\fR\-qualified parameter) is aliased by another
argument, or when copies between such objects overlap.  For example,
the call to the \f(CW\*(C`strcpy\*(C'\fR function below attempts to truncate the string
by replacing its initial characters with the last four.  However, because
the call writes the terminating \s-1NUL\s0 into \f(CW\*(C`a[4]\*(C'\fR, the copies overlap and
the call is diagnosed.

.IX Item "-Wno-inherited-variadic-ctor"
Suppress warnings about use of \*(C+11 inheriting constructors when the

on by default because the ellipsis is not inherited.
.IP "\fB\-Winline\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Winline"
Warn if a function that is declared as inline cannot be inlined.
Even with this option, the compiler does not warn about failures to
inline functions declared in system headers.
.Sp
The compiler uses a variety of heuristics to determine whether or not
to inline a function.  For example, the compiler takes into account
the size of the function being inlined and the amount of inlining
that has already been done in the current function.  Therefore,
seemingly insignificant changes in the source program can cause the
warnings produced by \fB\-Winline\fR to appear or disappear.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-invalid\-offsetof\fR (\*(C+ and Objective\-\*(C+ only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-invalid-offsetof ( and Objective- only)"
Suppress warnings from applying the \f(CW\*(C`offsetof\*(C'\fR macro to a non-POD
type.  According to the 2014 \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 standard, applying \f(CW\*(C`offsetof\*(C'\fR
to a non-standard-layout type is undefined.  In existing \*(C+ implementations,
however, \f(CW\*(C`offsetof\*(C'\fR typically gives meaningful results.
This flag is for users who are aware that they are
writing nonportable code and who have deliberately chosen to ignore the
warning about it.

The restrictions on \f(CW\*(C`offsetof\*(C'\fR may be relaxed in a future version
of the \*(C+ standard.

Warn for suspicious use of integer values where boolean values are expected,
such as conditional expressions (?:) using non-boolean integer constants in
boolean context, like \f(CW\*(C`if (a <= b ? 2 : 3)\*(C'\fR.  Or left shifting of signed
integers in boolean context, like \f(CW\*(C`for (a = 0; 1 << a; a++);\*(C'\fR.  Likewise

This warning is enabled by \fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-int\-to\-pointer\-cast\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-int-to-pointer-cast"
Suppress warnings from casts to pointer type of an integer of a

an error. \fBWint-to-pointer-cast\fR is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-to\-int\-cast\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4

Warn if \f(CW\*(C`long long\*(C'\fR type is used.  This is enabled by either
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR or \fB\-Wtraditional\fR in \s-1ISO C90\s0 and \*(C+98

.IX Item "-Wvariadic-macros"
Warn if variadic macros are used in \s-1ISO C90\s0 mode, or if the \s-1GNU\s0
alternate syntax is used in \s-1ISO C99\s0 mode.  This is enabled by either
\&\fB\-Wpedantic\fR or \fB\-Wtraditional\fR.  To inhibit the warning
messages, use \fB\-Wno\-variadic\-macros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvarargs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvarargs"
Warn upon questionable usage of the macros used to handle variable
arguments like \f(CW\*(C`va_start\*(C'\fR.  This is default.  To inhibit the
warning messages, use \fB\-Wno\-varargs\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wvector\-operation\-performance\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvector-operation-performance"
Warn if vector operation is not implemented via \s-1SIMD\s0 capabilities of the
architecture.  Mainly useful for the performance tuning.
Vector operation can be implemented \f(CW\*(C`piecewise\*(C'\fR, which means that the
scalar operation is performed on every vector element; 
\&\f(CW\*(C`in parallel\*(C'\fR, which means that the vector operation is implemented
using scalars of wider type, which normally is more performance efficient;
and \f(CW\*(C`as a single scalar\*(C'\fR, which means that vector fits into a
scalar type.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-virtual\-move\-assign\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wno-virtual-move-assign"
Suppress warnings about inheriting from a virtual base with a
non-trivial \*(C+11 move assignment operator.  This is dangerous because
if the virtual base is reachable along more than one path, it is
moved multiple times, which can mean both objects end up in the
moved-from state.  If the move assignment operator is written to avoid
moving from a moved-from object, this warning can be disabled.
.IP "\fB\-Wvla\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvla"
Warn if a variable-length array is used in the code.
\&\fB\-Wno\-vla\fR prevents the \fB\-Wpedantic\fR warning of
the variable-length array.
.IP "\fB\-Wvla\-larger\-than=\fR\fIbyte-size\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvla-larger-than=byte-size"
If this option is used, the compiler will warn for declarations of
variable-length arrays whose size is either unbounded, or bounded
by an argument that allows the array size to exceed \fIbyte-size\fR
bytes.  This is similar to how \fB\-Walloca\-larger\-than=\fR\fIbyte-size\fR
works, but with variable-length arrays.
.Sp
Note that \s-1GCC\s0 may optimize small variable-length arrays of a known
value into plain arrays, so this warning may not get triggered for
such arrays.
.Sp
\&\fB\-Wvla\-larger\-than=\fR\fB\s-1PTRDIFF_MAX\s0\fR is enabled by default but
is typically only effective when \fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR is active (default

to \fB\-Wvla\-larger\-than=\fR\fB\s-1SIZE_MAX\s0\fR or larger.
.IP "\fB\-Wvolatile\-register\-var\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wvolatile-register-var"
Warn if a register variable is declared volatile.  The volatile
modifier does not inhibit all optimizations that may eliminate reads
and/or writes to register variables.  This warning is enabled by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wdisabled\-optimization\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wdisabled-optimization"
Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that \s-1GCC\s0's optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; \s-1GCC\s0 refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.
.IP "\fB\-Wpointer\-sign\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wpointer-sign (C and Objective-C only)"
Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
\&\fB\-Wall\fR and by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, which can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-pointer\-sign\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wstack\-protector\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wstack-protector"
This option is only active when \fB\-fstack\-protector\fR is active.  It
warns about functions that are not protected against stack smashing.
.IP "\fB\-Woverlength\-strings\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Woverlength-strings"
Warn about string constants that are longer than the \*(L"minimum
maximum\*(R" length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard's minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
.Sp
The limit applies \fIafter\fR string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing \s-1NUL. \s0 In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  \*(C+98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in \*(C+.
.Sp
This option is implied by \fB\-Wpedantic\fR, and can be disabled with
\&\fB\-Wno\-overlength\-strings\fR.
.IP "\fB\-Wunsuffixed\-float\-constants\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4
.IX Item "-Wunsuffixed-float-constants (C and Objective-C only)"
Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with \fB\-Wsystem\-headers\fR it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the \f(CW\*(C`FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64\*(C'\fR pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.
.IP "\fB\-Wno\-designated\-init\fR (C and Objective-C only)" 4

.SS "Options for Debugging Your Program"
.IX Subsection "Options for Debugging Your Program"
To tell \s-1GCC\s0 to emit extra information for use by a debugger, in almost 
all cases you need only to add \fB\-g\fR to your other options.
.PP
\&\s-1GCC\s0 allows you to use \fB\-g\fR with
\&\fB\-O\fR.  The shortcuts taken by optimized code may occasionally
be surprising: some variables you declared may not exist
at all; flow of control may briefly move where you did not expect it;
some statements may not be executed because they compute constant
results or their values are already at hand; some statements may
execute in different places because they have been moved out of loops.
Nevertheless it is possible to debug optimized output.  This makes
it reasonable to use the optimizer for programs that might have bugs.
.PP
If you are not using some other optimization option, consider
using \fB\-Og\fR with \fB\-g\fR.  
With no \fB\-O\fR option at all, some compiler passes that collect
information useful for debugging do not run at all, so that
\&\fB\-Og\fR may result in a better debugging experience.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Produce debugging information in the operating system's native format
(stabs, \s-1COFF, XCOFF,\s0 or \s-1DWARF\s0).  \s-1GDB\s0 can work with this debugging
information.
.Sp
On most systems that use stabs format, \fB\-g\fR enables use of extra
debugging information that only \s-1GDB\s0 can use; this extra information
makes debugging work better in \s-1GDB\s0 but probably makes other debuggers
crash or
refuse to read the program.  If you want to control for certain whether
to generate the extra information, use \fB\-gstabs+\fR, \fB\-gstabs\fR,

Level 0 produces no debug information at all.  Thus, \fB\-g0\fR negates

.IX Item "-femit-class-debug-always"
Instead of emitting debugging information for a \*(C+ class in only one
object file, emit it in all object files using the class.  This option
should be used only with debuggers that are unable to handle the way \s-1GCC\s0

.IX Item "-fno-merge-debug-strings"
Direct the linker to not merge together strings in the debugging
information that are identical in different object files.  Merging is

When compiling files residing in directory \fI\fIold\fI\fR, record
debugging information describing them as if the files resided in
directory \fI\fInew\fI\fR instead.  This can be used to replace a
build-time path with an install-time path in the debug info.  It can
also be used to change an absolute path to a relative path by using
\&\fI.\fR for \fInew\fR.  This can give more reproducible builds, which

where to find the source files. See also \fB\-ffile\-prefix\-map\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvar\-tracking\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvar-tracking"
Run variable tracking pass.  It computes where variables are stored at each

comdat section since the linker can then remove duplicates.
But not all \s-1DWARF\s0 consumers support \f(CW\*(C`.debug_types\*(C'\fR sections yet

Augment variable location lists with progressive view numbers implied
from the line number table.  This enables debug information consumers to
inspect state at certain points of the program, even if no instructions
associated with the corresponding source locations are present at that
point.  If the assembler lacks support for view numbers in line number
tables, this will cause the compiler to emit the line number table,
which generally makes them somewhat less compact.  The augmented line
number tables and location lists are fully backward-compatible, so they
can be consumed by debug information consumers that are not aware of
these augmentations, but they won't derive any benefit from them either.
.Sp
This is enabled by default when outputting \s-1DWARF 2\s0 debug information at
the normal level, as long as there is assembler support,
\&\fB\-fvar\-tracking\-assignments\fR is enabled and
\&\fB\-gstrict\-dwarf\fR is not.  When assembler support is not
available, this may still be enabled, but it will force \s-1GCC\s0 to output
internal line number tables, and if

certainly lead to silently mismatching location views.

There is a proposed representation for view numbers that is not backward

be enabled with \fB\-gvariable\-location\-views=incompat5\fR.  This

compression in \s-1ELF\s0 gABI format), or \fBzlib-gnu\fR (use zlib

Specify the struct-like types
for which the compiler generates debug information.
The intent is to reduce duplicate struct debug information
between different object files within the same program.
.Sp
This option is a detailed version of
\&\fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-reduced\fR and \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-baseonly\fR,
which serves for most needs.
.Sp
A specification has the syntax[\fBdir:\fR|\fBind:\fR][\fBord:\fR|\fBgen:\fR](\fBany\fR|\fBsys\fR|\fBbase\fR|\fBnone\fR)
.Sp
The optional first word limits the specification to
structs that are used directly (\fBdir:\fR) or used indirectly (\fBind:\fR).
A struct type is used directly when it is the type of a variable, member.
Indirect uses arise through pointers to structs.
That is, when use of an incomplete struct is valid, the use is indirect.
An example is
\&\fBstruct one direct; struct two * indirect;\fR.
.Sp
The optional second word limits the specification to
ordinary structs (\fBord:\fR) or generic structs (\fBgen:\fR).
Generic structs are a bit complicated to explain.
For \*(C+, these are non-explicit specializations of template classes,
or non-template classes within the above.
Other programming languages have generics,
but \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed\fR does not yet implement them.
.Sp
The third word specifies the source files for those
structs for which the compiler should emit debug information.
The values \fBnone\fR and \fBany\fR have the normal meaning.
The value \fBbase\fR means that
the base of name of the file in which the type declaration appears
must match the base of the name of the main compilation file.
In practice, this means that when compiling \fIfoo.c\fR, debug information
is generated for types declared in that file and \fIfoo.h\fR,
but not other header files.
The value \fBsys\fR means those types satisfying \fBbase\fR
or declared in system or compiler headers.
.Sp
You may need to experiment to determine the best settings for your application.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-femit\-struct\-debug\-detailed=all\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fno\-eliminate\-unused\-debug\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-eliminate-unused-debug-types"
Normally, when producing \s-1DWARF\s0 output, \s-1GCC\s0 avoids producing debug symbol 
output for types that are nowhere used in the source file being compiled.
Sometimes it is useful to have \s-1GCC\s0 emit debugging
information for all types declared in a compilation
unit, regardless of whether or not they are actually used
in that compilation unit, for example 
if, in the debugger, you want to cast a value to a type that is
not actually used in your program (but is declared).  More often,
however, this results in a significant amount of wasted space.
.SS "Options That Control Optimization"
.IX Subsection "Options That Control Optimization"
These options control various sorts of optimizations.
.PP
Without any optimization option, the compiler's goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.
.PP
Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
.PP
The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
.PP
Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
.PP
Most optimizations are completely disabled at \fB\-O0\fR or if an
\&\fB\-O\fR level is not set on the command line, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.  Similarly, \fB\-Og\fR suppresses
many optimization passes.
.PP
Depending on the target and how \s-1GCC\s0 was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each \fB\-O\fR level than
those listed here.  You can invoke \s-1GCC\s0 with \fB\-Q \-\-help=optimizers\fR
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.

.IX Item "-fkeep-static-consts"
Emit variables declared \f(CW\*(C`static const\*(C'\fR when optimization isn't turned
on, even if the variables aren't referenced.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the \fB\-fno\-keep\-static\-consts\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmerge-constants"
Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.
.Sp
This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use \fB\-fno\-merge\-constants\fR to inhibit this
behavior.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fmerge\-all\-constants\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmerge-all-constants"
Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
.Sp
This option implies \fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR.  In addition to
\&\fB\-fmerge\-constants\fR this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or \*(C+ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched"
Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
.IP "\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\-allow\-regmoves\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves"
Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges are
deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
\&\fB\-fmodulo\-sched\fR enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-branch\-count\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-branch-count-reg"
Disable the optimization pass that scans for opportunities to use 
\&\*(L"decrement and branch\*(R" instructions on a count register instead of
instruction sequences that decrement a register, compare it against zero, and
then branch based upon the result.  This option is only meaningful on
architectures that support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC,
\&\s-1IA\-64\s0 and S/390.  Note that the \fB\-fno\-branch\-count\-reg\fR option
doesn't remove the decrement and branch instructions from the generated
instruction stream introduced by other optimization passes.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fbranch\-count\-reg\fR at \fB\-O1\fR and higher,
except for \fB\-Og\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-function\-cse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-function-cse"
Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function's address explicitly.
.Sp
This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations
performed when this option is not used.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-ffunction\-cse\fR
.IP "\fB\-fno\-zero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-zero-initialized-in-bss"
If the target supports a \s-1BSS\s0 section, \s-1GCC\s0 by default puts variables that
are initialized to zero into \s-1BSS. \s0 This can save space in the resulting
code.
.Sp
This option turns off this behavior because some programs explicitly
rely on variables going to the data section\-\-\-e.g., so that the
resulting executable can find the beginning of that section and/or make
assumptions based on that.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fzero\-initialized\-in\-bss\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fthread\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fthread-jumps"
Perform optimizations that check to see if a jump branches to a
location where another comparison subsumed by the first is found.  If
so, the first branch is redirected to either the destination of the
second branch or a point immediately following it, depending on whether
the condition is known to be true or false.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-wide\-types\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-wide-types"
When using a type that occupies multiple registers, such as \f(CW\*(C`long
long\*(C'\fR on a 32\-bit system, split the registers apart and allocate them
independently.  This normally generates better code for those types,
but may make debugging more difficult.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR,

.IP "\fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-follow-jumps"
In common subexpression elimination (\s-1CSE\s0), scan through jump instructions
when the target of the jump is not reached by any other path.  For
example, when \s-1CSE\s0 encounters an \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with an
\&\f(CW\*(C`else\*(C'\fR clause, \s-1CSE\s0 follows the jump when the condition
tested is false.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcse-skip-blocks"
This is similar to \fB\-fcse\-follow\-jumps\fR, but causes \s-1CSE\s0 to
follow jumps that conditionally skip over blocks.  When \s-1CSE\s0
encounters a simple \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement with no else clause,
\&\fB\-fcse\-skip\-blocks\fR causes \s-1CSE\s0 to follow the jump around the
body of the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.

.IP "\fB\-fgcse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse"
Perform a global common subexpression elimination pass.
This pass also performs global constant and copy propagation.
.Sp
\&\fINote:\fR When compiling a program using computed gotos, a \s-1GCC\s0
extension, you may get better run-time performance if you disable
the global common subexpression elimination pass by adding
\&\fB\-fno\-gcse\fR to the command line.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-lm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR is enabled, global common subexpression elimination
attempts to move loads that are only killed by stores into themselves.  This
allows a loop containing a load/store sequence to be changed to a load outside
the loop, and a copy/store within the loop.
.Sp
Enabled by default when \fB\-fgcse\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-sm"
When \fB\-fgcse\-sm\fR is enabled, a store motion pass is run after
global common subexpression elimination.  This pass attempts to move
stores out of loops.  When used in conjunction with \fB\-fgcse\-lm\fR,
loops containing a load/store sequence can be changed to a load before
the loop and a store after the loop.
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-las\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-las"
When \fB\-fgcse\-las\fR is enabled, the global common subexpression
elimination pass eliminates redundant loads that come after stores to the
same memory location (both partial and full redundancies).
.Sp
Not enabled at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgcse-after-reload"
When \fB\-fgcse\-after\-reload\fR is enabled, a redundant load elimination
pass is performed after reload.  The purpose of this pass is to clean up
redundant spilling.
.Sp
Enabled by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-faggressive\-loop\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-faggressive-loop-optimizations"
This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed
integer overflows or out-of-bound array accesses.  The bounds for the
number of iterations of a loop are used to guide loop unrolling and peeling
and loop exit test optimizations.
This option is enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-funconstrained\-commons\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funconstrained-commons"
This option tells the compiler that variables declared in common blocks
(e.g. Fortran) may later be overridden with longer trailing arrays. This
prevents certain optimizations that depend on knowing the array bounds.
.IP "\fB\-fcrossjumping\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcrossjumping"
Perform cross-jumping transformation.
This transformation unifies equivalent code and saves code size.  The
resulting code may or may not perform better than without cross-jumping.
.Sp

.IP "\fB\-fauto\-inc\-dec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fauto-inc-dec"
Combine increments or decrements of addresses with memory accesses.
This pass is always skipped on architectures that do not have
instructions to support this.  Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher on architectures that support this.
.IP "\fB\-fdce\fR" 4

Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fif\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fif-conversion"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps into branch-less equivalents.  This
includes use of conditional moves, min, max, set flags and abs instructions, and
some tricks doable by standard arithmetics.  The use of conditional execution
on chips where it is available is controlled by \fB\-fif\-conversion2\fR.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR, but

not with \fB\-Og\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdeclone\-ctor\-dtor\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdeclone-ctor-dtor"
The \*(C+ \s-1ABI\s0 requires multiple entry points for constructors and
destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete object, and
one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards.
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are
clones, which means two copies of the function.  With this option, the
base and complete variants are changed to be thunks that call a common
implementation.
.Sp
Enabled by \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdelete-null-pointer-checks"
Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides at address zero.
This option enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in \s-1GCC\s0 use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that a memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.
.Sp
Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use \fB\-fno\-delete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.
.Sp
This option is enabled by default on most targets.  On Nios \s-1II ELF,\s0 it
defaults to off.  On \s-1AVR, CR16,\s0 and \s-1MSP430,\s0 this option is completely disabled.
.Sp
Passes that use the dataflow information
are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize"
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to direct calls.  This
is done both within a procedure and interprocedurally as part of
indirect inlining (\fB\-findirect\-inlining\fR) and interprocedural constant
propagation (\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR).
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\-speculatively\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize-speculatively"
Attempt to convert calls to virtual functions to speculative direct calls.
Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem
useless after further optimization, they are converted back into original form.
.IP "\fB\-fdevirtualize\-at\-ltrans\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdevirtualize-at-ltrans"
Stream extra information needed for aggressive devirtualization when running
the link-time optimizer in local transformation mode.  
This option enables more devirtualization but
significantly increases the size of streamed data. For this reason it is
disabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fexpensive\-optimizations\fR" 4

Perform a number of minor optimizations that are relatively expensive.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-free\fR" 4

Attempt to remove redundant extension instructions.  This is especially
helpful for the x86\-64 architecture, which implicitly zero-extends in 64\-bit
registers after writing to their lower 32\-bit half.
.Sp
Enabled for Alpha, AArch64 and x86 at levels \fB\-O2\fR,
\&\fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-lifetime\-dse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-lifetime-dse"
In \*(C+ the value of an object is only affected by changes within its
lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object has an indeterminate
value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object are dead when
the object is destroyed.  Normally dead store elimination will take
advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the object
storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use this
flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores before the
constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new clears the object
storage) but still treat the object as dead after the destructor you,
can use \fB\-flifetime\-dse=1\fR.  The default behavior can be
explicitly selected with \fB\-flifetime\-dse=2\fR.
\&\fB\-flifetime\-dse=0\fR is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-lifetime\-dse\fR.

size register sets.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-algorithm=\fR\fIalgorithm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-algorithm=algorithm"
Use the specified coloring algorithm for the integrated register
allocator.  The \fIalgorithm\fR argument can be \fBpriority\fR, which
specifies Chow's priority coloring, or \fB\s-1CB\s0\fR, which specifies
Chaitin-Briggs coloring.  Chaitin-Briggs coloring is not implemented
for all architectures, but for those targets that do support it, it is
the default because it generates better code.
.IP "\fB\-fira\-region=\fR\fIregion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-region=region"
Use specified regions for the integrated register allocator.  The
\&\fIregion\fR argument should be one of the following:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBall\fR" 4
.IX Item "all"
Use all loops as register allocation regions.
This can give the best results for machines with a small and/or
irregular register set.
.IP "\fBmixed\fR" 4
.IX Item "mixed"
Use all loops except for loops with small register pressure 
as the regions.  This value usually gives

(\fB\-O\fR, \fB\-O2\fR, ...).
.IP "\fBone\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-fira\-loop\-pressure\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fira-loop-pressure"
Use \s-1IRA\s0 to evaluate register pressure in loops for decisions to move

.IP "\fB\-fno\-ira\-share\-save\-slots\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ira-share-save-slots"
Disable sharing of stack slots used for saving call-used hard

If supported for the target machine, attempt to reorder instructions to

.IP "\fB\-fsemantic\-interposition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsemantic-interposition"
Some object formats, like \s-1ELF,\s0 allow interposing of symbols by the 
dynamic linker.
This means that for symbols exported from the \s-1DSO,\s0 the compiler cannot perform
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other optimizations in anticipation
that the function or variable in question may change. While this feature is
useful, for example, to rewrite memory allocation functions by a debugging
implementation, it is expensive in the terms of code quality.
With \fB\-fno\-semantic\-interposition\fR the compiler assumes that 
if interposition happens for functions the overwriting function will have 
precisely the same semantics (and side effects). 
Similarly if interposition happens
for variables, the constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag
has no effect for functions explicitly declared inline

Emit function prologues only before parts of the function that need it,
rather than at the top of the function.  This flag is enabled by default at
\&\fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fshrink\-wrap\-separate\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fshrink-wrap-separate"
Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue and epilogue separately, so that
those parts are only executed when needed.
This option is on by default, but has no effect unless \fB\-fshrink\-wrap\fR
is also turned on and the target supports this.
.IP "\fB\-fcaller\-saves\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcaller-saves"
Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code.
.Sp
This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fcombine\-stack\-adjustments\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcombine-stack-adjustments"
Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory references
and then tries to find ways to combine them.
.Sp
Enabled by default at \fB\-O1\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-ra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-ra"
Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers are not used by
any called function.  In that case it is not necessary to save and restore
them around calls.  This is only possible if called functions are part of
same compilation unit as current function and they are compiled before it.
.Sp
Enabled at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR, however the option
is disabled if generated code will be instrumented for profiling
(\fB\-p\fR, or \fB\-pg\fR) or if callee's register usage cannot be known
exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose prologues
and epilogues in \s-1RTL\s0).
.IP "\fB\-fconserve\-stack\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fconserve-stack"
Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less
stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
implies setting the \fBlarge-stack-frame\fR parameter to 100
and the \fBlarge-stack-frame-growth\fR parameter to 400.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-reassoc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-reassoc"
Perform reassociation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fcode\-hoisting\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcode-hoisting"
Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the
evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function exit
as early as possible.  This is especially useful as a code size
optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-pre\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-pre"
Perform partial redundancy elimination (\s-1PRE\s0) on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-partial\-pre\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-partial-pre"
Make partial redundancy elimination (\s-1PRE\s0) more aggressive.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-forwprop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-forwprop"
Perform forward propagation on trees.  This flag is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-fre\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-fre"
Perform full redundancy elimination (\s-1FRE\s0) on trees.  The difference
between \s-1FRE\s0 and \s-1PRE\s0 is that \s-1FRE\s0 only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than \s-1PRE,\s0 though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-phiprop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-phiprop"
Perform hoisting of loads from conditional pointers on trees.  This
pass is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fhoist\-adjacent\-loads\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fhoist-adjacent-loads"
Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-else if the
loads are from adjacent locations in the same structure and the target
architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This flag is enabled
by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-copy\-prop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-copy-prop"
Perform copy propagation on trees.  This pass eliminates unnecessary
copy operations.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-pure\-const\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-pure-const"
Discover which functions are pure or constant.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-reference\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-reference"
Discover which static variables do not escape the
compilation unit.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-reference\-addressable\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-reference-addressable"
Discover read-only, write-only and non-addressable static variables.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-stack\-alignment\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-stack-alignment"
Reduce stack alignment on call sites if possible.
Enabled by default.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-pta\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-pta"
Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-profile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-profile"
Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
\&\f(CW\*(C`cold\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`noreturn\*(C'\fR, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp"
Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-Os\fR and \fB\-O3\fR.
It is also enabled by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-cp\-clone\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-cp-clone"
Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see \fB\-\-param ipcp\-unit\-growth=\fR\fIvalue\fR).
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
It is also enabled by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-bit\-cp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-bit-cp"
When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and
by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
It requires that \fB\-fipa\-cp\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-vrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-vrp"
When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
ranges. This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR. It requires
that \fB\-fipa\-cp\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fipa\-icf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fipa-icf"
Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only variables.
The optimization reduces code size and may disturb unwind stacks by replacing
a function by equivalent one with a different name. The optimization works
more effectively with link-time optimization enabled.
.Sp
Although the behavior is similar to the Gold Linker's \s-1ICF\s0 optimization, \s-1GCC ICF\s0
works on different levels and thus the optimizations are not same \- there are
equivalences that are found only by \s-1GCC\s0 and equivalences found only by Gold.
.Sp
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-flive\-patching=\fR\fIlevel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flive-patching=level"
Control \s-1GCC\s0's optimizations to produce output suitable for live-patching.
.Sp
If the compiler's optimization uses a function's body or information extracted
from its body to optimize/change another function, the latter is called an
impacted function of the former.  If a function is patched, its impacted
functions should be patched too.
.Sp
The impacted functions are determined by the compiler's interprocedural
optimizations.  For example, a caller is impacted when inlining a function
into its caller,
cloning a function and changing its caller to call this new clone,
or extracting a function's pureness/constness information to optimize
its direct or indirect callers, etc.
.Sp
Usually, the more \s-1IPA\s0 optimizations enabled, the larger the number of
impacted functions for each function.  In order to control the number of
impacted functions and more easily compute the list of impacted function,
\&\s-1IPA\s0 optimizations can be partially enabled at two different levels.
.Sp
The \fIlevel\fR argument should be one of the following:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBinline-clone\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-clone"
Only enable inlining and cloning optimizations, which includes inlining,
cloning, interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates and partial inlining.
As a result, when patching a function, all its callers and its clones'
callers are impacted, therefore need to be patched as well.
.Sp
\&\fB\-flive\-patching=inline\-clone\fR disables the following optimization flags:
\&\fB\-fwhole\-program  \-fipa\-pta  \-fipa\-reference  \-fipa\-ra 
\&\-fipa\-icf  \-fipa\-icf\-functions  \-fipa\-icf\-variables 
\&\-fipa\-bit\-cp  \-fipa\-vrp  \-fipa\-pure\-const  \-fipa\-reference\-addressable 
\&\-fipa\-stack\-alignment\fR
.IP "\fBinline-only-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-only-static"
Only enable inlining of static functions.
As a result, when patching a static function, all its callers are impacted
and so need to be patched as well.
.Sp
In addition to all the flags that \fB\-flive\-patching=inline\-clone\fR
disables,
\&\fB\-flive\-patching=inline\-only\-static\fR disables the following additional
optimization flags:
\&\fB\-fipa\-cp\-clone  \-fipa\-sra  \-fpartial\-inlining  \-fipa\-cp\fR
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
When \fB\-flive\-patching\fR is specified without any value, the default value
is \fIinline-clone\fR.
.Sp
This flag is disabled by default.

Note that \fB\-flive\-patching\fR is not supported with link-time optimization
(\fB\-flto\fR).

.IP "\fB\-fisolate\-erroneous\-paths\-dereference\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fisolate-erroneous-paths-dereference"
Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to
dereferencing a null pointer.  Isolate those paths from the main control
flow and turn the statement with erroneous or undefined behavior into a trap.
This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher and depends on
\&\fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR also being enabled.
.IP "\fB\-fisolate\-erroneous\-paths\-attribute\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fisolate-erroneous-paths-attribute"
Detect paths that trigger erroneous or undefined behavior due to a null value
being used in a way forbidden by a \f(CW\*(C`returns_nonnull\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`nonnull\*(C'\fR
attribute.  Isolate those paths from the main control flow and turn the

Perform forward store motion on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-bit\-ccp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-bit-ccp"
Perform sparse conditional bit constant propagation on trees and propagate
pointer alignment information.
This pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at \fB\-O1\fR and higher, except for \fB\-Og\fR.
It requires that \fB\-ftree\-ccp\fR is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ccp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ccp"
Perform sparse conditional constant propagation (\s-1CCP\s0) on trees.  This
pass only operates on local scalar variables and is enabled by default
at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fssa\-backprop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fssa-backprop"
Propagate information about uses of a value up the definition chain
in order to simplify the definitions.  For example, this pass strips
sign operations if the sign of a value never matters.  The flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fssa\-phiopt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fssa-phiopt"
Perform pattern matching on \s-1SSA PHI\s0 nodes to optimize conditional

except for \fB\-Og\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-switch\-conversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-switch-conversion"
Perform conversion of simple initializations in a switch to
initializations from a scalar array.  This flag is enabled by default
at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-tail\-merge\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-tail-merge"
Look for identical code sequences.  When found, replace one with a jump to the
other.  This optimization is known as tail merging or cross jumping.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher.  The compilation time
in this pass can
be limited using \fBmax-tail-merge-comparisons\fR parameter and
\&\fBmax-tail-merge-iterations\fR parameter.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dce\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dce"
Perform dead code elimination (\s-1DCE\s0) on trees.  This flag is enabled by

.IX Item "-ftree-builtin-call-dce"
Perform conditional dead code elimination (\s-1DCE\s0) for calls to built-in functions
that may set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR but are otherwise free of side effects.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O2\fR and higher if \fB\-Os\fR is not also
specified.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dominator\-opts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dominator-opts"
Perform a variety of simple scalar cleanups (constant/copy
propagation, redundancy elimination, range propagation and expression
simplification) based on a dominator tree traversal.  This also
performs jump threading (to reduce jumps to jumps). This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-dse\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-dse"
Perform dead store elimination (\s-1DSE\s0) on trees.  A dead store is a store into
a memory location that is later overwritten by another store without
any intervening loads.  In this case the earlier store can be deleted.  This
flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ch\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ch"
Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag
is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.  It is not enabled
for \fB\-Os\fR, since it usually increases code size.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-optimize\fR" 4

Perform loop nest optimizations.  Same as
\&\fB\-floop\-nest\-optimize\fR.  To use this code transformation, \s-1GCC\s0 has
to be configured with \fB\-\-with\-isl\fR to enable the Graphite loop
transformation infrastructure.
.IP "\fB\-fgraphite\-identity\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fgraphite-identity"
Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
\&\fB\-fgraphite\-identity\fR we can check the costs or benefits of the
\&\s-1GIMPLE \-\s0> \s-1GRAPHITE \-\s0> \s-1GIMPLE\s0 transformation.  Some minimal optimizations
are also performed by the code generator isl, like index splitting and
dead code elimination in loops.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-nest\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-nest-optimize"
Enable the isl based loop nest optimizer.  This is a generic loop nest
optimizer based on the Pluto optimization algorithms.  It calculates a loop
structure optimized for data-locality and parallelism.  This option
is experimental.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-parallelize\-all\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-parallelize-all"
Use the Graphite data dependence analysis to identify loops that can
be parallelized.  Parallelize all the loops that can be analyzed to
not contain loop carried dependences without checking that it is
profitable to parallelize the loops.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-coalesce\-vars\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-coalesce-vars"
While transforming the program out of the \s-1SSA\s0 representation, attempt to
reduce copying by coalescing versions of different user-defined
variables, instead of just compiler temporaries.  This may severely
limit the ability to debug an optimized program compiled with
\&\fB\-fno\-var\-tracking\-assignments\fR.  In the negated form, this flag
prevents \s-1SSA\s0 coalescing of user variables.  This option is enabled by
default if optimization is enabled, and it does very little otherwise.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-if\-convert\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-if-convert"
Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to
branch-less equivalents.  The intent is to remove control-flow from
the innermost loops in order to improve the ability of the
vectorization pass to handle these loops.  This is enabled by default
if vectorization is enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-distribution\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-distribution"
Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on
big loop bodies and allow further loop optimizations, like
parallelization or vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop

Perform loop distribution of patterns that can be code generated with
calls to a library.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR, and
by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
.Sp
This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to
memset zero.  For example, the loop
.Sp
.Vb 4

\&          A(I) = 0
\&          B(I) = A(I) + I

It is also enabled by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-floop\-interchange\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-interchange"
Perform loop interchange outside of graphite.  This flag can improve cache
performance on loop nest and allow further loop optimizations, like
vectorization, to take place.  For example, the loop

.IP "\fB\-floop\-unroll\-and\-jam\fR" 4
.IX Item "-floop-unroll-and-jam"
Apply unroll and jam transformations on feasible loops.  In a loop
nest this unrolls the outer loop by some factor and fuses the resulting
multiple inner loops.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O3\fR.
It is also enabled by \fB\-fprofile\-use\fR and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-im\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-im"
Perform loop invariant motion on trees.  This pass moves only invariants that
are hard to handle at \s-1RTL\s0 level (function calls, operations that expand to
nontrivial sequences of insns).  With \fB\-funswitch\-loops\fR it also moves
operands of conditions that are invariant out of the loop, so that we can use
just trivial invariantness analysis in loop unswitching.  The pass also includes
store motion.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-loop\-ivcanon\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-loop-ivcanon"
Create a canonical counter for number of iterations in loops for which
determining number of iterations requires complicated analysis.  Later
optimizations then may determine the number easily.  Useful especially
in connection with unrolling.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-scev\-cprop\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-scev-cprop"
Perform final value replacement.  If a variable is modified in a loop
in such a way that its value when exiting the loop can be determined using
only its initial value and the number of loop iterations, replace uses of
the final value by such a computation, provided it is sufficiently cheap.
This reduces data dependencies and may allow further simplifications.
Enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-fivopts\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fivopts"
Perform induction variable optimizations (strength reduction, induction
variable merging and induction variable elimination) on trees.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-parallelize\-loops=n\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-parallelize-loops=n"
Parallelize loops, i.e., split their iteration space to run in n threads.
This is only possible for loops whose iterations are independent
and can be arbitrarily reordered.  The optimization is only
profitable on multiprocessor machines, for loops that are CPU-intensive,
rather than constrained e.g. by memory bandwidth.  This option
implies \fB\-pthread\fR, and thus is only supported on targets
that have support for \fB\-pthread\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-pta\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-pta"
Perform function-local points-to analysis on trees.  This flag is
enabled by default at \fB\-O1\fR and higher, except for \fB\-Og\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-sra\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-sra"
Perform scalar replacement of aggregates.  This pass replaces structure
references with scalars to prevent committing structures to memory too
early.  This flag is enabled by default at \fB\-O1\fR and higher,
except for \fB\-Og\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fstore\-merging\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstore-merging"
Perform merging of narrow stores to consecutive memory addresses.  This pass
merges contiguous stores of immediate values narrower than a word into fewer
wider stores to reduce the number of instructions.  This is enabled by default
at \fB\-O2\fR and higher as well as \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-ter\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-ter"
Perform temporary expression replacement during the \s-1SSA\-\s0>normal phase.  Single
use/single def temporaries are replaced at their use location with their
defining expression.  This results in non-GIMPLE code, but gives the expanders
much more complex trees to work on resulting in better \s-1RTL\s0 generation.  This is
enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-slsr\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-slsr"
Perform straight-line strength reduction on trees.  This recognizes related
expressions involving multiplications and replaces them by less expensive
calculations when possible.  This is enabled by default at \fB\-O\fR and
higher.
.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vectorize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vectorize"
Perform vectorization on trees. This flag enables \fB\-ftree\-loop\-vectorize\fR

and \fB\-fauto\-profile\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvect\-cost\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvect-cost-model=model"
Alter the cost model used for vectorization.  The \fImodel\fR argument
should be one of \fBunlimited\fR, \fBdynamic\fR or \fBcheap\fR.
With the \fBunlimited\fR model the vectorized code-path is assumed
to be profitable while with the \fBdynamic\fR model a runtime check
guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration

scalar loop.  The \fBcheap\fR model disables vectorization of
loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due to
required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise
is equal to the \fBdynamic\fR model.
The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is
either \fBdynamic\fR or \fBcheap\fR.

Alter the cost model used for vectorization of loops marked with the OpenMP
simd directive.  The \fImodel\fR argument should be one of
\&\fBunlimited\fR, \fBdynamic\fR, \fBcheap\fR.  All values of \fImodel\fR

.IP "\fB\-ftree\-vrp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftree-vrp"
Perform Value Range Propagation on trees.  This is similar to the
constant propagation pass, but instead of values, ranges of values are
propagated.  This allows the optimizers to remove unnecessary range
checks like array bound checks and null pointer checks.  This is

elimination is only done if \fB\-fdelete\-null\-pointer\-checks\fR is

long dependency chains, thus improving efficiency of the scheduling passes.
.Sp
A combination of \fB\-fweb\fR and \s-1CSE\s0 is often sufficient to obtain the
same effect.  However, that is not reliable in cases where the loop body

Do not substitute constants for known return value of formatted output

\&\f(CW\*(C`vsnprintf\*(C'\fR (but not \f(CW\*(C`printf\*(C'\fR of \f(CW\*(C`fprintf\*(C'\fR).  This
transformation allows \s-1GCC\s0 to optimize or even eliminate branches based
on the known return value of these functions called with arguments that
are either constant, or whose values are known to be in a range that
makes determining the exact return value possible.  For example, when
\&\fB\-fprintf\-return\-value\fR is in effect, both the branch and the
body of the \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR statement (but not the call to \f(CW\*(C`snprint\*(C'\fR)

.IX Item "-fno-guess-branch-probability"
Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (\fB\-fprofile\-arcs\fR).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_expect\*(C'\fR, then the heuristics are
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_expect\*(C'\fR info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_expect\*(C'\fR can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_expect\*(C'\fR are easier to understand.

code size (except sometimes due to secondary effects like alignment),
or \fBstc\fR, the \*(L"software trace cache\*(R" algorithm, which tries to
put all often executed code together, minimizing the number of branches
executed by making extra copies of code.

In addition to reordering basic blocks in the compiled function, in order
to reduce number of taken branches, partitions hot and cold basic blocks
into separate sections of the assembly and \fI.o\fR files, to improve
paging and cache locality performance.
.Sp
This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling or unwind tables (on targets using setjump/longjump or target specific scheme), for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.  When \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR is used this option is not
enabled by default (to avoid linker errors), but may be enabled
explicitly (if using a working linker).
.Sp
Enabled for x86 at levels \fB\-O2\fR, \fB\-O3\fR, \fB\-Os\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freorder\-functions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freorder-functions"
Reorder functions in the object file in order to

subsections \f(CW\*(C`.text.hot\*(C'\fR for most frequently executed functions and
\&\f(CW\*(C`.text.unlikely\*(C'\fR for unlikely executed functions.  Reordering is done by
the linker so object file format must support named sections and linker must
place them in a reasonable way.

This option isn't effective unless you either provide profile feedback

\&\f(CW\*(C`hot\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`cold\*(C'\fR attributes.

.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-aliasing"
Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and \*(C+), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an \f(CW\*(C`unsigned int\*(C'\fR can alias an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR, but not a
\&\f(CW\*(C`void*\*(C'\fR or a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR.  A character type may alias any other
type.
.Sp
Pay special attention to code like this:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        union a_union {
\&          int i;
\&          double d;
\&        };

\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          return t.i;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called \*(L"type-punning\*(R") is common.  Even with
\&\fB\-fstrict\-aliasing\fR, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.    However, this code might not:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        int f() {
\&          union a_union t;
\&          int* ip;
\&          t.d = 3.0;
\&          ip = &t.i;
\&          return *ip;
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        int f() {
\&          double d = 3.0;
\&          return ((union a_union *) &d)\->i;

.Sp
This option should not be used in combination with \fB\-flto\fR.
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.
.IP "\fB\-flto[=\fR\fIn\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto[=n]"
This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates \s-1GIMPLE \s0(one of \s-1GCC\s0's internal
representations) and writes it to special \s-1ELF\s0 sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these \s-1ELF\s0 sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
.Sp
To use the link-time optimizer, \fB\-flto\fR and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time.  
For example:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto foo.c
\&        gcc \-c \-O2 \-flto bar.c
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.o bar.o
.Ve
.Sp
The first two invocations to \s-1GCC\s0 save a bytecode representation
of \s-1GIMPLE\s0 into special \s-1ELF\s0 sections inside \fIfoo.o\fR and
\&\fIbar.o\fR.  The final invocation reads the \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode from
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
\&\fIfoo.o\fR and \fIbar.o\fR are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in \s-1GCC\s0 to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
\&\fIbar.o\fR into functions in \fIfoo.o\fR and vice-versa.
.Sp
Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-flto \-O2 foo.c bar.c
.Ve
.Sp
The above generates bytecode for \fIfoo.c\fR and \fIbar.c\fR,
merges them together into a single \s-1GIMPLE\s0 representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce \fImyprog\fR.
.Sp
The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to perform the link step.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the \fB\-flto\fR command-line option.  
You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization
by passing \fB\-fno\-lto\fR to the link command.
.Sp
To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
.Sp
When a file is compiled with \fB\-flto\fR without
\&\fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and the usual
final code (see \fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR.  This means that
object files with \s-1LTO\s0 information can be linked as normal object
files; if \fB\-fno\-lto\fR is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
\&\fB\-fno\-fat\-lto\-objects\fR is enabled the compile stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.
.Sp
When producing the final binary, \s-1GCC\s0 only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecodes and final object code.  \s-1GCC\s0 automatically selects
which files to optimize in \s-1LTO\s0 mode and which files to link without
further processing.
.Sp
Generally, options specified at link time override those
specified at compile time, although in some cases \s-1GCC\s0 attempts to infer
link-time options from the settings used to compile the input files.
.Sp
If you do not specify an optimization level option \fB\-O\fR at
link time, then \s-1GCC\s0 uses the highest optimization level 
used when compiling the object files.  Note that it is generally 
ineffective to specify an optimization level option only at link time and 
not at compile time, for two reasons.  First, compiling without 
optimization suppresses compiler passes that gather information 
needed for effective optimization at link time.  Second, some early
optimization passes can be performed only at compile time and 
not at link time.
.Sp
There are some code generation flags preserved by \s-1GCC\s0 when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link.
Currently, the following options and their settings are taken from
the first object file that explicitly specifies them: 
\&\fB\-fPIC\fR, \fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fcommon\fR,
\&\fB\-fexceptions\fR, \fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR, \fB\-fgnu\-tm\fR
and all the \fB\-m\fR target flags.
.Sp
Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units,
and trying to override this at link time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as \fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR
and \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR.
.Sp
Other options such as \fB\-ffp\-contract\fR, \fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR,
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR, \fB\-fno\-trapv\fR or \fB\-fno\-strict\-aliasing\fR
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
\&\fB\-fno\-strict\-overflow\fR, \fB\-fwrapv\fR and \fB\-fno\-trapv\fR take
precedence; and for example \fB\-ffp\-contract=off\fR takes precedence
over \fB\-ffp\-contract=fast\fR.  You can override them at link time.
.Sp
If \s-1LTO\s0 encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to \s-1ISO C99 6.2.7\s0), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.
.Sp
Another feature of \s-1LTO\s0 is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&        gcc \-c \-flto foo.c
\&        g++ \-c \-flto bar.cc
\&        gfortran \-c \-flto baz.f90
\&        g++ \-o myprog \-flto \-O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o \-lgfortran
.Ve
.Sp
Notice that the final link is done with \fBg++\fR to get the \*(C+
runtime libraries and \fB\-lgfortran\fR is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in \s-1LTO\s0 mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.
.Sp
If object files containing \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
\&\fIlibfoo.a\fR, it is possible to extract and use them in an \s-1LTO\s0 link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for \s-1LTO,\s0 use \fBgcc-ar\fR and \fBgcc-ranlib\fR instead of \fBar\fR
and \fBranlib\fR; 
to show the symbols of object files with \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode, use
\&\fBgcc-nm\fR.  Those commands require that \fBar\fR, \fBranlib\fR
and \fBnm\fR have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the
flag \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR to ensure that the library participates in
the \s-1LTO\s0 optimization process:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-o myprog \-O2 \-flto \-fuse\-linker\-plugin a.o b.o \-lfoo
.Ve
.Sp
With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
\&\s-1GIMPLE\s0 files from \fIlibfoo.a\fR and passes them on to the running \s-1GCC\s0
to make them part of the aggregated \s-1GIMPLE\s0 image to be optimized.
.Sp
If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside \fIlibfoo.a\fR
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the \s-1LTO\s0 optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both \s-1LTO\s0 optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
\&\fB\-flto\fR \fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR.
.Sp
Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine \fB\-flto\fR and \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see \fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR).
.Sp
The current implementation of \s-1LTO\s0 makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
\&\s-1GCC\s0 do not work with an older or newer version of \s-1GCC.\s0
.Sp
Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information on systems other than those using a combination of \s-1ELF\s0 and
\&\s-1DWARF.\s0
.Sp
If you specify the optional \fIn\fR, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using \fIn\fR
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed \fBmake\fR program.  The
environment variable \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for \fIn\fR is 1.
.Sp
You can also specify \fB\-flto=jobserver\fR to use \s-1GNU\s0 make's
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling \s-1GCC\s0 is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a \fB+\fR to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if \fB\s-1MAKE\s0\fR is
\&\s-1GNU\s0 make.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-partition=\fR\fIalg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-partition=alg"
Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.
The value is either \fB1to1\fR to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or \fBbalanced\fR to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or \fBmax\fR to create
new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying \fBnone\fR
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. 
The default value is \fBbalanced\fR. While \fB1to1\fR can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the \fBmax\fR
partitioning is intended for internal testing only.
The value \fBone\fR specifies that exactly one partition should be
used while the value \fBnone\fR bypasses partitioning and executes
the link-time optimization step directly from the \s-1WPA\s0 phase.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-odr\-type\-merging\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-odr-type-merging"
Enable streaming of mangled types names of \*(C+ types and their unification
at link time.  This increases size of \s-1LTO\s0 object files, but enables
diagnostics about One Definition Rule violations.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-compression\-level=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-compression-level=n"
This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate
language written to \s-1LTO\s0 object files, and is only meaningful in
conjunction with \s-1LTO\s0 mode (\fB\-flto\fR).  Valid
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values
outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
given, a default balanced compression setting is used.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-linker\-plugin\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fuse-linker-plugin"
Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This
option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold
or in \s-1GNU\s0 ld 2.21 or newer.
.Sp
This option enables the extraction of object files with \s-1GIMPLE\s0 bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to \fB\-fwhole\-program\fR.
See \fB\-flto\fR for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.
.Sp
This option is enabled by default when \s-1LTO\s0 support in \s-1GCC\s0 is enabled
and \s-1GCC\s0 was configured for use with
a linker supporting plugins (\s-1GNU\s0 ld 2.21 or newer or gold).
.IP "\fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffat-lto-objects"
Fat \s-1LTO\s0 objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language
and the object code. This makes them usable for both \s-1LTO\s0 linking and normal
linking. This option is effective only when compiling with \fB\-flto\fR
and is ignored at link time.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-fat\-lto\-objects\fR improves compilation time over plain \s-1LTO,\s0 but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of \s-1LTO.\s0 It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
\&\fBnm\fR, \fBar\fR and \fBranlib\fR
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  \s-1GCC\s0 provides the \fBgcc-ar\fR,
\&\fBgcc-nm\fR, \fBgcc-ranlib\fR wrappers to pass the right options
to these tools. With non fat \s-1LTO\s0 makefiles need to be modified to use them.
.Sp
Note that modern binutils provide plugin auto-load mechanism.
Installing the linker plugin into \fI\f(CI$libdir\fI/bfd\-plugins\fR has the same
effect as usage of the command wrappers (\fBgcc-ar\fR, \fBgcc-nm\fR and
\&\fBgcc-ranlib\fR).

support.

This pass only applies to certain targets that cannot explicitly represent
the comparison operation before register allocation is complete.

Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may
be inconsistent due to missed counter updates. When this option is specified,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses heuristics to correct or smooth out such inconsistencies. By

By default, \s-1GCC\s0 emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not
match the source code.  This error can be turned into a warning by using
\&\fB\-Wno\-error=coverage\-mismatch\fR.  Note this may result in poorly
optimized code.  Additionally, by default, \s-1GCC\s0 also emits a warning message if
the feedback profiles do not exist (see \fB\-Wmissing\-profile\fR).

\&\fIpath\fR is the name of a file containing AutoFDO profile information.

The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point 
arithmetic.  These options trade off between speed and
correctness.  All must be specifically enabled.
.IP "\fB\-ffloat\-store\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ffloat-store"
Do not store floating-point variables in registers, and inhibit other
options that might change whether a floating-point value is taken from a
register or memory.
.Sp
This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a \f(CW\*(C`double\*(C'\fR is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of \s-1IEEE\s0 floating
point.  Use \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
.IP "\fB\-fexcess\-precision=\fR\fIstyle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexcess-precision=style"
This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point operations occur in a format with more precision or
range than the \s-1IEEE\s0 standard and interchange floating-point types.  By
default, \fB\-fexcess\-precision=fast\fR is in effect; this means that
operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the types specified
in the source if that would result in faster code, and it is unpredictable
when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place.
When compiling C, if \fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is specified then
excess precision follows the rules specified in \s-1ISO C99\s0; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas \fB\-ffloat\-store\fR only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as \fB\-std=c99\fR is used.
\&\fB\-ffast\-math\fR enables \fB\-fexcess\-precision=fast\fR by default
regardless of whether a strict conformance option is used.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=standard\fR is not implemented for languages
other than C.  On the x86, it has no effect if \fB\-mfpmath=sse\fR
or \fB\-mfpmath=sse+387\fR is specified; in the former case, \s-1IEEE\s0
semantics apply without excess precision, and in the latter, rounding
is unpredictable.

\&\fB\-fno\-signaling\-nans\fR, \fB\-fcx\-limited\-range\fR and
\&\fB\-fexcess\-precision=fast\fR.
.Sp
This option causes the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FAST_MATH_\|_\*(C'\fR to be defined.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option besides
\&\fB\-Ofast\fR since it can result in incorrect output for programs
that depend on an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications
for math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-math-errno"
Do not set \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR after calling math functions that are executed
with a single instruction, e.g., \f(CW\*(C`sqrt\*(C'\fR.  A program that relies on
\&\s-1IEEE\s0 exceptions for math error handling may want to use this flag
for speed while maintaining \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic compatibility.
.Sp
This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for
math functions. It may, however, yield faster code for programs
that do not require the guarantees of these specifications.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-fmath\-errno\fR.
.Sp
On Darwin systems, the math library never sets \f(CW\*(C`errno\*(C'\fR.  There is
therefore no reason for the compiler to consider the possibility that
it might, and \fB\-fno\-math\-errno\fR is the default.
.IP "\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funsafe-math-optimizations"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that (a) assume
that arguments and results are valid and (b) may violate \s-1IEEE\s0 or
\&\s-1ANSI\s0 standards.  When used at link time, it may include libraries
or startup files that change the default \s-1FPU\s0 control word or other
similar optimizations.

This option is not turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since
it can result in incorrect output for programs that depend on
an exact implementation of \s-1IEEE\s0 or \s-1ISO\s0 rules/specifications for

The default is \fB\-fno\-unsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fassociative\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fassociative-math"
Allow re-association of operands in series of floating-point operations.
This violates the \s-1ISO C\s0 and \*(C+ language standard by possibly changing
computation result.  \s-1NOTE:\s0 re-ordering may change the sign of zero as
well as ignore NaNs and inhibit or create underflow or overflow (and
thus cannot be used on code that relies on rounding behavior like
\&\f(CW\*(C`(x + 2**52) \- 2**52\*(C'\fR.  May also reorder floating-point comparisons
and thus may not be used when ordered comparisons are required.
This option requires that both \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and
\&\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR be in effect.  Moreover, it doesn't make
much sense with \fB\-frounding\-math\fR. For Fortran the option
is automatically enabled when both \fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR and
\&\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR are in effect.

The default is \fB\-fno\-associative\-math\fR.
.IP "\fB\-freciprocal\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freciprocal-math"
Allow the reciprocal of a value to be used instead of dividing by
the value if this enables optimizations.  For example \f(CW\*(C`x / y\*(C'\fR
can be replaced with \f(CW\*(C`x * (1/y)\*(C'\fR, which is useful if \f(CW\*(C`(1/y)\*(C'\fR
is subject to common subexpression elimination.  Note that this loses
precision and increases the number of flops operating on the value.

.IP "\fB\-fno\-signed\-zeros\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-signed-zeros"
Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that ignore the
signedness of zero.  \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic specifies the behavior of
distinct +0.0 and \-0.0 values, which then prohibits simplification
of expressions such as x+0.0 or 0.0*x (even with \fB\-ffinite\-math\-only\fR).
This option implies that the sign of a zero result isn't significant.

The default is \fB\-fsigned\-zeros\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-trapping\-math\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-trapping-math"
Compile code assuming that floating-point operations cannot generate
user-visible traps.  These traps include division by zero, overflow,
underflow, inexact result and invalid operation.  This option requires

allow faster code if one relies on \*(L"non-stop\*(R" \s-1IEEE\s0 arithmetic, for example.
.Sp
This option should never be turned on by any \fB\-O\fR option since

truncations.  This option should be specified for programs that change
the \s-1FP\s0 rounding mode dynamically, or that may be executed with a

.IP "\fB\-frename\-registers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-frename-registers"
Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
most benefits processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in
a \*(L"home register\*(R".

Unroll loops whose number of iterations can be determined at compile time or
upon entry to the loop.  \fB\-funroll\-loops\fR implies
\&\fB\-frerun\-cse\-after\-loop\fR, \fB\-fweb\fR and \fB\-frename\-registers\fR.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with

.IP "\fB\-funroll\-all\-loops\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funroll-all-loops"
Unroll all loops, even if their number of iterations is uncertain when

.IX Item "-fversion-loops-for-strides"
If a loop iterates over an array with a variable stride, create another
version of the loop that assumes the stride is always one.  For example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
\&          x[i * stride] = ...;
.Ve
.Sp
becomes:
.Sp
.Vb 6

This is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in Fortran where
(for example) it allows better vectorization assuming contiguous accesses.

Place each function or data item into its own section in the output

in the output file.
.Sp
Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to
improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the
\&\s-1ELF\s0 object format have linkers with such optimizations.  On \s-1AIX,\s0 the linker
rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The performance impact
varies.
.Sp
Together with a linker garbage collection (linker \fB\-\-gc\-sections\fR
option) these options may lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after
stripping).
.Sp
On \s-1ELF/DWARF\s0 systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the debug
information.  There could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.
.Sp
Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.  When
you specify these options, the assembler and linker create larger object and
executable files and are also slower.  These options affect code generation.
They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using relative
locations inside a translation unit since the locations are unknown until
link time.  An example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call
instructions.
.IP "\fB\-fbranch\-target\-load\-optimize\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fbranch-target-load-optimize"
Perform branch target register load optimization before prologue / epilogue

Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared \*(L"anchor\*(R" symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation

For example, the implementation of the following function \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        static int a, b, c;

.Ve
.Sp
usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with \fB\-fsection\-anchors\fR, it accesses the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn't valid C):
.Sp
.Vb 5

.IP "\fBmax-crossjump-edges\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-crossjump-edges"
The maximum number of incoming edges to consider for cross-jumping.
The algorithm used by \fB\-fcrossjumping\fR is O(N^2) in

more aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with
probably small improvement in executable size.
.IP "\fBmin-crossjump-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "min-crossjump-insns"
The minimum number of instructions that must be matched at the end

The maximum number of instructions to duplicate to a block that jumps

unfactored.
.IP "\fBmax-delay-slot-insn-search\fR" 4
.IX Item "max-delay-slot-insn-search"
The maximum number of instructions to consider when looking for an

aggressive optimization, making the compilation time increase with probably
small improvement in execution time.

When trying to fill delay slots, the maximum number of instructions to

.IP "\fBlarge-function-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-function-growth"

For example, parameter value 100 limits large function growth to 2.0 times
the original size.
.IP "\fBlarge-unit-insns\fR" 4
.IX Item "large-unit-insns"
The limit specifying large translation unit.  Growth caused by inlining of
units larger than this limit is limited by \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.
For small units this might be too tight.
For example, consider a unit consisting of function A
that is inline and B that just calls A three times.  If B is small relative to
A, the growth of unit is 300\e% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
smaller units, the size is increased to \fB\-\-param large-unit-insns\fR
before applying \fB\-\-param inline-unit-growth\fR.
.IP "\fBinline-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "inline-unit-growth"

feedback) are not accounted into the unit size.
.IP "\fBipcp-unit-growth\fR" 4
.IX Item "ipcp-unit-growth"

.Sp
When profile feedback is available (see \fB\-fprofile\-generate\fR) the actual

Scaling factor in calculation of maximum distance an expression
can be moved by \s-1GCSE\s0 optimizations.  This is currently supported only in the

The maximum number of loop iterations we predict statically.  This is useful
in cases where a function contains a single loop with known bound and
another loop with unknown bound.
The known number of iterations is predicted correctly, while

.IX Item "stack-clash-protection-probe-interval"
Stack clash protection involves probing stack space as it is allocated.  This

.IP "\fBggc-min-expand\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-expand"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses a garbage collector to manage its own memory allocation.  This
parameter specifies the minimum percentage by which the garbage
collector's heap should be allowed to expand between collections.
Tuning this may improve compilation speed; it has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is 30% + 70% * (\s-1RAM/1GB\s0) with an upper bound of 100% when
\&\s-1RAM \s0>= 1GB.  If \f(CW\*(C`getrlimit\*(C'\fR is available, the notion of \*(L"\s-1RAM\*(R"\s0 is
the smallest of actual \s-1RAM\s0 and \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_DATA\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`RLIMIT_AS\*(C'\fR.  If
\&\s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a particular platform, the lower
bound of 30% is used.  Setting this parameter and
\&\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR to zero causes a full collection to occur at
every opportunity.  This is extremely slow, but can be useful for
debugging.
.IP "\fBggc-min-heapsize\fR" 4
.IX Item "ggc-min-heapsize"
Minimum size of the garbage collector's heap before it begins bothering
to collect garbage.  The first collection occurs after the heap expands
by \fBggc-min-expand\fR% beyond \fBggc-min-heapsize\fR.  Again,
tuning this may improve compilation speed, and has no effect on code
generation.
.Sp
The default is the smaller of \s-1RAM/8, RLIMIT_RSS,\s0 or a limit that
tries to ensure that \s-1RLIMIT_DATA\s0 or \s-1RLIMIT_AS\s0 are not exceeded, but
with a lower bound of 4096 (four megabytes) and an upper bound of
131072 (128 megabytes).  If \s-1GCC\s0 is not able to calculate \s-1RAM\s0 on a
particular platform, the lower bound is used.  Setting this parameter
very large effectively disables garbage collection.  Setting this

to occur at every opportunity.
.IP "\fBmax-reload-search-insns\fR" 4

.IX Item "prefetch-minimum-stride"
Minimum constant stride, in bytes, to start using prefetch hints for.  If
the stride is less than this threshold, prefetch hints will not be issued.

This setting is useful for processors that have hardware prefetchers, in
which case there may be conflicts between the hardware prefetchers and
the software prefetchers.  If the hardware prefetchers have a maximum
stride they can handle, it should be used here to improve the use of
software prefetchers.

.SS "Program Instrumentation Options"
.IX Subsection "Program Instrumentation Options"
\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports a number of command-line options that control adding
run-time instrumentation to the code it normally generates.  
For example, one purpose of instrumentation is collect profiling
statistics for use in finding program hot spots, code coverage
analysis, or profile-guided optimizations.
Another class of program instrumentation is adding run-time checking 
to detect programming errors like invalid pointer
dereferences or out-of-bounds array accesses, as well as deliberately
hostile attacks such as stack smashing or \*(C+ vtable hijacking.
There is also a general hook which can be used to implement other
forms of tracing or function-level instrumentation for debug or
program analysis purposes.

Generate extra code to write profile information suitable for the

Add code so that program flow \fIarcs\fR are instrumented.  During
execution the program records how many times each branch and call is
executed and how many times it is taken or returns.  On targets that support
constructors with priority support, profiling properly handles constructors,
destructors and \*(C+ constructors (and destructors) of classes which are used
as a type of a global variable.
.Sp
When the compiled
program exits it saves this data to a file called
\&\fI\fIauxname\fI.gcda\fR for each source file.  The data may be used for
profile-directed optimizations (\fB\-fbranch\-probabilities\fR), or for
test coverage analysis (\fB\-ftest\-coverage\fR).  Each object file's
\&\fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of the output file, if
explicitly specified and it is not the final executable, otherwise it is
the basename of the source file.  In both cases any suffix is removed

\&\fB\-fsanitize\-recover=\fR controls error recovery mode for sanitizers
mentioned in comma-separated list of \fIopts\fR.  Enabling this option
for a sanitizer component causes it to attempt to continue
running the program as if no error happened.  This means multiple
runtime errors can be reported in a single program run, and the exit
code of the program may indicate success even when errors
have been reported.  The \fB\-fno\-sanitize\-recover=\fR option
can be used to alter
this behavior: only the first detected error is reported
and program then exits with a non-zero exit code.
.Sp
Currently this feature only works for \fB\-fsanitize=undefined\fR (and its suboptions

For these sanitizers error recovery is turned on by default,
except \fB\-fsanitize=address\fR, for which this feature is experimental.
\&\fB\-fsanitize\-recover=all\fR and \fB\-fno\-sanitize\-recover=all\fR is also
accepted, the former enables recovery for all sanitizers that support it,
the latter disables recovery for all sanitizers that support it.
.Sp
Even if a recovery mode is turned on the compiler side, it needs to be also
enabled on the runtime library side, otherwise the failures are still fatal.
The runtime library defaults to \f(CW\*(C`halt_on_error=0\*(C'\fR for
ThreadSanitizer and UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, while default value for
AddressSanitizer is \f(CW\*(C`halt_on_error=1\*(C'\fR. This can be overridden through
setting the \f(CW\*(C`halt_on_error\*(C'\fR flag in the corresponding environment variable.

.IX Item "-fcf-protection=[full|branch|return|none]"
Enable code instrumentation of control-flow transfers to increase
program security by checking that target addresses of control-flow
transfer instructions (such as indirect function call, function return,
indirect jump) are valid.  This prevents diverting the flow of control
to an unexpected target.  This is intended to protect against such
threats as Return-oriented Programming (\s-1ROP\s0), and similarly
call/jmp\-oriented programming (\s-1COP/JOP\s0).
.Sp
The value \f(CW\*(C`branch\*(C'\fR tells the compiler to implement checking of
validity of control-flow transfer at the point of indirect branch
instructions, i.e. call/jmp instructions.  The value \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR
implements checking of validity at the point of returning from a
function.  The value \f(CW\*(C`full\*(C'\fR is an alias for specifying both
\&\f(CW\*(C`branch\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR. The value \f(CW\*(C`none\*(C'\fR turns off
instrumentation.
.Sp
The macro \f(CW\*(C`_\|_CET_\|_\*(C'\fR is defined when \fB\-fcf\-protection\fR is

\&\f(CW\*(C`branch\*(C'\fR and the second bit of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_CET_\|_\*(C'\fR is set to 1 for
the \f(CW\*(C`return\*(C'\fR.

You can also use the \f(CW\*(C`nocf_check\*(C'\fR attribute to identify
which functions and calls should be skipped from instrumentation.

.IP "\fB\-fstack\-check\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-check"
Generate code to verify that you do not go beyond the boundary of the
stack.  You should specify this flag if you are running in an
environment with multiple threads, but you only rarely need to specify it in
a single-threaded environment since stack overflow is automatically
detected on nearly all systems if there is only one stack.
.Sp
Note that this switch does not actually cause checking to be done; the
operating system or the language runtime must do that.  The switch causes
generation of code to ensure that they see the stack being extended.
.Sp
You can additionally specify a string parameter: \fBno\fR means no
checking, \fBgeneric\fR means force the use of old-style checking,
\&\fBspecific\fR means use the best checking method and is equivalent
to bare \fB\-fstack\-check\fR.
.Sp
Old-style checking is a generic mechanism that requires no specific
target support in the compiler but comes with the following drawbacks:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
.IX Item "1."
Modified allocation strategy for large objects: they are always
allocated dynamically if their size exceeds a fixed threshold.  Note this
may change the semantics of some code.
.IP "2." 4
.IX Item "2."
Fixed limit on the size of the static frame of functions: when it is
topped by a particular function, stack checking is not reliable and
a warning is issued by the compiler.
.IP "3." 4
.IX Item "3."
Inefficiency: because of both the modified allocation strategy and the
generic implementation, code performance is hampered.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
Note that old-style stack checking is also the fallback method for
\&\fBspecific\fR if no target support has been added in the compiler.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fstack\-check=\fR is designed for Ada's needs to detect infinite recursion
and stack overflows.  \fBspecific\fR is an excellent choice when compiling
Ada code.  It is not generally sufficient to protect against stack-clash

.RE
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-clash\-protection\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-clash-protection"
Generate code to prevent stack clash style attacks.  When this option is

allocations from jumping over any stack guard page provided by the
operating system.
.Sp
Most targets do not fully support stack clash protection.  However, on
those targets \fB\-fstack\-clash\-protection\fR will protect dynamic stack
allocations.  \fB\-fstack\-clash\-protection\fR may also provide limited

Generate code to ensure that the stack does not grow beyond a certain value,
either the value of a register or the address of a symbol.  If a larger
stack is required, a signal is raised at run time.  For most targets,
the signal is raised before the stack overruns the boundary, so
it is possible to catch the signal without taking special precautions.
.Sp
For instance, if the stack starts at absolute address \fB0x80000000\fR
and grows downwards, you can use the flags
\&\fB\-fstack\-limit\-symbol=_\|_stack_limit\fR and
\&\fB\-Wl,\-\-defsym,_\|_stack_limit=0x7ffe0000\fR to enforce a stack limit
of 128KB.  Note that this may only work with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.

\&\f(CW\*(C`no_stack_limit\*(C'\fR function attribute.
.IP "\fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsplit-stack"
Generate code to automatically split the stack before it overflows.
The resulting program has a discontiguous stack which can only
overflow if the program is unable to allocate any more memory.  This
is most useful when running threaded programs, as it is no longer
necessary to calculate a good stack size to use for each thread.  This
is currently only implemented for the x86 targets running
GNU/Linux.
.Sp
When code compiled with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR calls code compiled
without \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR, there may not be much stack space
available for the latter code to run.  If compiling all code,
including library code, with \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR is not an option,
then the linker can fix up these calls so that the code compiled
without \fB\-fsplit\-stack\fR always has a large stack.  Support for
this is implemented in the gold linker in \s-1GNU\s0 binutils release 2.21
and later.
.IP "\fB\-fvtable\-verify=\fR[\fBstd\fR|\fBpreinit\fR|\fBnone\fR]" 4

It turns on (or off, if using \fB\-fvtable\-verify=none\fR) the security
feature that verifies at run time, for every virtual call, that
the vtable pointer through which the call is made is valid for the type of
the object, and has not been corrupted or overwritten.  If an invalid vtable
pointer is detected at run time, an error is reported and execution of the
program is immediately halted.
.Sp
This option causes run-time data structures to be built at program startup,
which are used for verifying the vtable pointers.  
The options \fBstd\fR and \fBpreinit\fR
control the timing of when these data structures are built.  In both cases the
data structures are built before execution reaches \f(CW\*(C`main\*(C'\fR.  Using
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=std\fR causes the data structures to be built after
shared libraries have been loaded and initialized.
\&\fB\-fvtable\-verify=preinit\fR causes them to be built before shared
libraries have been loaded and initialized.

If this option appears multiple times in the command line with different

that it inserts and logs this information for each compilation unit.

The first argument is the address of the start of the current function,
which may be looked up exactly in the symbol table.
.Sp
This instrumentation is also done for functions expanded inline in other
functions.  The profiling calls indicate where, conceptually, the
inline function is entered and exited.  This means that addressable
versions of such functions must be available.  If all your uses of a
function are expanded inline, this may mean an additional expansion of
code size.  If you use \f(CW\*(C`extern inline\*(C'\fR in your C code, an
addressable version of such functions must be provided.  (This is
normally the case anyway, but if you get lucky and the optimizer always
expands the functions inline, you might have gotten away without
providing static copies.)
.Sp
A function may be given the attribute \f(CW\*(C`no_instrument_function\*(C'\fR, in
which case this instrumentation is not done.  This can be used, for
example, for the profiling functions listed above, high-priority
interrupt routines, and any functions from which the profiling functions
cannot safely be called (perhaps signal handlers, if the profiling
routines generate output or allocate memory).

excludes any inline function defined in files whose pathnames
contain \fI/bits/stl\fR or \fIinclude/sys\fR.
.Sp
If, for some reason, you want to include letter \fB,\fR in one of
\&\fIsym\fR, write \fB,\fR. For example,
\&\fB\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list=',,tmp'\fR
(note the single quote surrounding the option).
.IP "\fB\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-function\-list=\fR\fIsym\fR\fB,\fR\fIsym\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finstrument-functions-exclude-function-list=sym,sym,..."
This is similar to \fB\-finstrument\-functions\-exclude\-file\-list\fR,
but this option sets the list of function names to be excluded from
instrumentation.  The function name to be matched is its user-visible
name, such as \f(CW\*(C`vector<int> blah(const vector<int> &)\*(C'\fR, not the
internal mangled name (e.g., \f(CW\*(C`_Z4blahRSt6vectorIiSaIiEE\*(C'\fR).  The
match is done on substrings: if the \fIsym\fR parameter is a substring
of the function name, it is considered to be a match.  For C99 and \*(C+
extended identifiers, the function name must be given in \s-1UTF\-8,\s0 not
using universal character names.
.IP "\fB\-fpatchable\-function\-entry=\fR\fIN\fR\fB[,\fR\fIM\fR\fB]\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpatchable-function-entry=N[,M]"
Generate \fIN\fR NOPs right at the beginning
of each function, with the function entry point before the \fIM\fRth \s-1NOP.\s0
If \fIM\fR is omitted, it defaults to \f(CW0\fR so the
function entry points to the address just at the first \s-1NOP.\s0
The \s-1NOP\s0 instructions reserve extra space which can be used to patch in
any desired instrumentation at run time, provided that the code segment
is writable.  The amount of space is controllable indirectly via
the number of NOPs; the \s-1NOP\s0 instruction used corresponds to the instruction
emitted by the internal \s-1GCC\s0 back-end interface \f(CW\*(C`gen_nop\*(C'\fR.  This behavior
is target-specific and may also depend on the architecture variant and/or
other compilation options.
.Sp
For run-time identification, the starting addresses of these areas,
which correspond to their respective function entries minus \fIM\fR,
are additionally collected in the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_patchable_function_entries\*(C'\fR
section of the resulting binary.
.Sp
Note that the value of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((patchable_function_entry
(N,M)))\*(C'\fR takes precedence over command-line option
\&\fB\-fpatchable\-function\-entry=N,M\fR.  This can be used to increase
the area size or to remove it completely on a single function.
If \f(CW\*(C`N=0\*(C'\fR, no pad location is recorded.
.Sp
The \s-1NOP\s0 instructions are inserted at\-\-\-and maybe before, depending on
\&\fIM\fR\-\-\-the function entry address, even before the prologue.
.SS "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"
.IX Subsection "Options Controlling the Preprocessor"
These options control the C preprocessor, which is run on each C source
file before actual compilation.
.PP
If you use the \fB\-E\fR option, nothing is done except preprocessing.
Some of these options make sense only together with \fB\-E\fR because
they cause the preprocessor output to be unsuitable for actual
compilation.
.PP
In addition to the options listed here, there are a number of options 
to control search paths for include files documented in 
\&\fBDirectory Options\fR.  
Options to control preprocessor diagnostics are listed in 
\&\fBWarning Options\fR.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name"
Predefine \fIname\fR as a macro, with definition \f(CW1\fR.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR \fIname\fR\fB=\fR\fIdefinition\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D name=definition"
The contents of \fIdefinition\fR are tokenized and processed as if
they appeared during translation phase three in a \fB#define\fR
directive.  In particular, the definition is truncated by
embedded newline characters.
.Sp
If you are invoking the preprocessor from a shell or shell-like
program you may need to use the shell's quoting syntax to protect
characters such as spaces that have a meaning in the shell syntax.
.Sp
If you wish to define a function-like macro on the command line, write
its argument list with surrounding parentheses before the equals sign
(if any).  Parentheses are meaningful to most shells, so you should
quote the option.  With \fBsh\fR and \fBcsh\fR,
\&\fB\-D'\fR\fIname\fR\fB(\fR\fIargs...\fR\fB)=\fR\fIdefinition\fR\fB'\fR works.
.Sp
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options are processed in the order they
are given on the command line.  All \fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR and
\&\fB\-include\fR \fIfile\fR options are processed after all
\&\fB\-D\fR and \fB\-U\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-U\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-U name"
Cancel any previous definition of \fIname\fR, either built in or
provided with a \fB\-D\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-include\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-include file"
Process \fIfile\fR as if \f(CW\*(C`#include "file"\*(C'\fR appeared as the first
line of the primary source file.  However, the first directory searched
for \fIfile\fR is the preprocessor's working directory \fIinstead of\fR
the directory containing the main source file.  If not found there, it
is searched for in the remainder of the \f(CW\*(C`#include "..."\*(C'\fR search
chain as normal.
.Sp
If multiple \fB\-include\fR options are given, the files are included
in the order they appear on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-imacros\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-imacros file"
Exactly like \fB\-include\fR, except that any output produced by
scanning \fIfile\fR is thrown away.  Macros it defines remain defined.
This allows you to acquire all the macros from a header without also
processing its declarations.
.Sp
All files specified by \fB\-imacros\fR are processed before all files
specified by \fB\-include\fR.
.IP "\fB\-undef\fR" 4
.IX Item "-undef"
Do not predefine any system-specific or GCC-specific macros.  The
standard predefined macros remain defined.
.IP "\fB\-pthread\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pthread"
Define additional macros required for using the \s-1POSIX\s0 threads library.
You should use this option consistently for both compilation and linking.
This option is supported on GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives,
and also on x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
Instead of outputting the result of preprocessing, output a rule
suitable for \fBmake\fR describing the dependencies of the main
source file.  The preprocessor outputs one \fBmake\fR rule containing
the object file name for that source file, a colon, and the names of all
the included files, including those coming from \fB\-include\fR or
\&\fB\-imacros\fR command-line options.
.Sp
Unless specified explicitly (with \fB\-MT\fR or \fB\-MQ\fR), the
object file name consists of the name of the source file with any
suffix replaced with object file suffix and with any leading directory
parts removed.  If there are many included files then the rule is
split into several lines using \fB\e\fR\-newline.  The rule has no
commands.
.Sp
This option does not suppress the preprocessor's debug output, such as
\&\fB\-dM\fR.  To avoid mixing such debug output with the dependency
rules you should explicitly specify the dependency output file with
\&\fB\-MF\fR, or use an environment variable like
\&\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR.  Debug output
is still sent to the regular output stream as normal.
.Sp
Passing \fB\-M\fR to the driver implies \fB\-E\fR, and suppresses
warnings with an implicit \fB\-w\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MM"
Like \fB\-M\fR but do not mention header files that are found in
system header directories, nor header files that are included,
directly or indirectly, from such a header.
.Sp
This implies that the choice of angle brackets or double quotes in an
\&\fB#include\fR directive does not in itself determine whether that
header appears in \fB\-MM\fR dependency output.
.IP "\fB\-MF\fR \fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MF file"
When used with \fB\-M\fR or \fB\-MM\fR, specifies a
file to write the dependencies to.  If no \fB\-MF\fR switch is given
the preprocessor sends the rules to the same place it would send
preprocessed output.
.Sp
When used with the driver options \fB\-MD\fR or \fB\-MMD\fR,
\&\fB\-MF\fR overrides the default dependency output file.
.Sp
If \fIfile\fR is \fI\-\fR, then the dependencies are written to \fIstdout\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MG\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MG"
In conjunction with an option such as \fB\-M\fR requesting
dependency generation, \fB\-MG\fR assumes missing header files are
generated files and adds them to the dependency list without raising
an error.  The dependency filename is taken directly from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include\*(C'\fR directive without prepending any path.  \fB\-MG\fR
also suppresses preprocessed output, as a missing header file renders
this useless.
.Sp
This feature is used in automatic updating of makefiles.
.IP "\fB\-MP\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MP"
This option instructs \s-1CPP\s0 to add a phony target for each dependency
other than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing.  These
dummy rules work around errors \fBmake\fR gives if you remove header
files without updating the \fIMakefile\fR to match.
.Sp
This is typical output:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        test.o: test.c test.h
\&        
\&        test.h:
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MT\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MT target"
Change the target of the rule emitted by dependency generation.  By
default \s-1CPP\s0 takes the name of the main input file, deletes any
directory components and any file suffix such as \fB.c\fR, and
appends the platform's usual object suffix.  The result is the target.
.Sp
An \fB\-MT\fR option sets the target to be exactly the string you
specify.  If you want multiple targets, you can specify them as a single
argument to \fB\-MT\fR, or use multiple \fB\-MT\fR options.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-MT\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR might give
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.IP "\fB\-MQ\fR \fItarget\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MQ target"
Same as \fB\-MT\fR, but it quotes any characters which are special to
Make.  \fB\-MQ\ '$(objpfx)foo.o'\fR gives
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        $$(objpfx)foo.o: foo.c
.Ve
.Sp
The default target is automatically quoted, as if it were given with
\&\fB\-MQ\fR.
.IP "\fB\-MD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MD"
\&\fB\-MD\fR is equivalent to \fB\-M \-MF\fR \fIfile\fR, except that
\&\fB\-E\fR is not implied.  The driver determines \fIfile\fR based on
whether an \fB\-o\fR option is given.  If it is, the driver uses its
argument but with a suffix of \fI.d\fR, otherwise it takes the name
of the input file, removes any directory components and suffix, and
applies a \fI.d\fR suffix.
.Sp
If \fB\-MD\fR is used in conjunction with \fB\-E\fR, any
\&\fB\-o\fR switch is understood to specify the dependency output file, but if used without \fB\-E\fR, each \fB\-o\fR
is understood to specify a target object file.
.Sp
Since \fB\-E\fR is not implied, \fB\-MD\fR can be used to generate
a dependency output file as a side effect of the compilation process.
.IP "\fB\-MMD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-MMD"
Like \fB\-MD\fR except mention only user header files, not system
header files.
.IP "\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpreprocessed"
Indicate to the preprocessor that the input file has already been
preprocessed.  This suppresses things like macro expansion, trigraph
conversion, escaped newline splicing, and processing of most directives.
The preprocessor still recognizes and removes comments, so that you can
pass a file preprocessed with \fB\-C\fR to the compiler without
problems.  In this mode the integrated preprocessor is little more than
a tokenizer for the front ends.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is implicit if the input file has one of the
extensions \fB.i\fR, \fB.ii\fR or \fB.mi\fR.  These are the
extensions that \s-1GCC\s0 uses for preprocessed files created by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdirectives\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdirectives-only"
When preprocessing, handle directives, but do not expand macros.
.Sp
The option's behavior depends on the \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR
options.
.Sp
With \fB\-E\fR, preprocessing is limited to the handling of directives
such as \f(CW\*(C`#define\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`#ifdef\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`#error\*(C'\fR.  Other
preprocessor operations, such as macro expansion and trigraph
conversion are not performed.  In addition, the \fB\-dD\fR option is
implicitly enabled.
.Sp
With \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, predefinition of command line and most
builtin macros is disabled.  Macros such as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_LINE_\|_\*(C'\fR, which are
contextually dependent, are handled normally.  This enables compilation of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
With both \fB\-E\fR and \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR, the rules for
\&\fB\-fpreprocessed\fR take precedence.  This enables full preprocessing of
files previously preprocessed with \f(CW\*(C`\-E \-fdirectives\-only\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdollars\-in\-identifiers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdollars-in-identifiers"
Accept \fB$\fR in identifiers.
.IP "\fB\-fextended\-identifiers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fextended-identifiers"
Accept universal character names in identifiers.  This option is
enabled by default for C99 (and later C standard versions) and \*(C+.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-canonical\-system\-headers\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-canonical-system-headers"
When preprocessing, do not shorten system header paths with canonicalization.
.IP "\fB\-ftabstop=\fR\fIwidth\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftabstop=width"
Set the distance between tab stops.  This helps the preprocessor report
correct column numbers in warnings or errors, even if tabs appear on the
line.  If the value is less than 1 or greater than 100, the option is
ignored.  The default is 8.
.IP "\fB\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion\fR[\fB=\fR\fIlevel\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-ftrack-macro-expansion[=level]"
Track locations of tokens across macro expansions. This allows the
compiler to emit diagnostic about the current macro expansion stack
when a compilation error occurs in a macro expansion. Using this
option makes the preprocessor and the compiler consume more
memory. The \fIlevel\fR parameter can be used to choose the level of
precision of token location tracking thus decreasing the memory
consumption if necessary. Value \fB0\fR of \fIlevel\fR de-activates
this option. Value \fB1\fR tracks tokens locations in a
degraded mode for the sake of minimal memory overhead. In this mode
all tokens resulting from the expansion of an argument of a
function-like macro have the same location. Value \fB2\fR tracks
tokens locations completely. This value is the most memory hungry.
When this option is given no argument, the default parameter value is
\&\fB2\fR.
.Sp
Note that \f(CW\*(C`\-ftrack\-macro\-expansion=2\*(C'\fR is activated by default.
.IP "\fB\-fmacro\-prefix\-map=\fR\fIold\fR\fB=\fR\fInew\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fmacro-prefix-map=old=new"
When preprocessing files residing in directory \fI\fIold\fI\fR,
expand the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_FILE_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_BASE_FILE_\|_\*(C'\fR macros as if the
files resided in directory \fI\fInew\fI\fR instead.  This can be used
to change an absolute path to a relative path by using \fI.\fR for
\&\fInew\fR which can result in more reproducible builds that are
location independent.  This option also affects
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_FILE()\*(C'\fR during compilation.  See also
\&\fB\-ffile\-prefix\-map\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fexec\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexec-charset=charset"
Set the execution character set, used for string and character
constants.  The default is \s-1UTF\-8.  \s0\fIcharset\fR can be any encoding
supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fwide\-exec\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwide-exec-charset=charset"
Set the wide execution character set, used for wide string and
character constants.  The default is \s-1UTF\-32\s0 or \s-1UTF\-16,\s0 whichever
corresponds to the width of \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR.  As with
\&\fB\-fexec\-charset\fR, \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding supported
by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine; however, you will have
problems with encodings that do not fit exactly in \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-finput\-charset=\fR\fIcharset\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finput-charset=charset"
Set the input character set, used for translation from the character
set of the input file to the source character set used by \s-1GCC. \s0 If the
locale does not specify, or \s-1GCC\s0 cannot get this information from the
locale, the default is \s-1UTF\-8. \s0 This can be overridden by either the locale
or this command-line option.  Currently the command-line option takes
precedence if there's a conflict.  \fIcharset\fR can be any encoding
supported by the system's \f(CW\*(C`iconv\*(C'\fR library routine.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-deps\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-deps"
When using precompiled headers, this flag
causes the dependency-output flags to also list the files from the
precompiled header's dependencies.  If not specified, only the
precompiled header are listed and not the files that were used to
create it, because those files are not consulted when a precompiled
header is used.
.IP "\fB\-fpch\-preprocess\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpch-preprocess"
This option allows use of a precompiled header together with \fB\-E\fR.  It inserts a special \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC pch_preprocess "\f(CIfilename\f(CW"\*(C'\fR in the output to mark
the place where the precompiled header was found, and its \fIfilename\fR.
When \fB\-fpreprocessed\fR is in use, \s-1GCC\s0 recognizes this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR
and loads the \s-1PCH.\s0
.Sp
This option is off by default, because the resulting preprocessed output
is only really suitable as input to \s-1GCC. \s0 It is switched on by
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
You should not write this \f(CW\*(C`#pragma\*(C'\fR in your own code, but it is
safe to edit the filename if the \s-1PCH\s0 file is available in a different
location.  The filename may be absolute or it may be relative to \s-1GCC\s0's
current directory.
.IP "\fB\-fworking\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fworking-directory"
Enable generation of linemarkers in the preprocessor output that
let the compiler know the current working directory at the time of
preprocessing.  When this option is enabled, the preprocessor
emits, after the initial linemarker, a second linemarker with the
current working directory followed by two slashes.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this
directory, when it's present in the preprocessed input, as the
directory emitted as the current working directory in some debugging
information formats.  This option is implicitly enabled if debugging
information is enabled, but this can be inhibited with the negated
form \fB\-fno\-working\-directory\fR.  If the \fB\-P\fR flag is
present in the command line, this option has no effect, since no
\&\f(CW\*(C`#line\*(C'\fR directives are emitted whatsoever.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR \fIpredicate\fR\fB=\fR\fIanswer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A predicate=answer"
Make an assertion with the predicate \fIpredicate\fR and answer
\&\fIanswer\fR.  This form is preferred to the older form \fB\-A\fR
\&\fIpredicate\fR\fB(\fR\fIanswer\fR\fB)\fR, which is still supported, because
it does not use shell special characters.
.IP "\fB\-A \-\fR\fIpredicate\fR\fB=\fR\fIanswer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A -predicate=answer"
Cancel an assertion with the predicate \fIpredicate\fR and answer
\&\fIanswer\fR.
.IP "\fB\-C\fR" 4
.IX Item "-C"
Do not discard comments.  All comments are passed through to the output
file, except for comments in processed directives, which are deleted
along with the directive.
.Sp
You should be prepared for side effects when using \fB\-C\fR; it
causes the preprocessor to treat comments as tokens in their own right.
For example, comments appearing at the start of what would be a
directive line have the effect of turning that line into an ordinary
source line, since the first token on the line is no longer a \fB#\fR.
.IP "\fB\-CC\fR" 4
.IX Item "-CC"
Do not discard comments, including during macro expansion.  This is
like \fB\-C\fR, except that comments contained within macros are
also passed through to the output file where the macro is expanded.
.Sp
In addition to the side effects of the \fB\-C\fR option, the
\&\fB\-CC\fR option causes all \*(C+\-style comments inside a macro
to be converted to C\-style comments.  This is to prevent later use
of that macro from inadvertently commenting out the remainder of
the source line.
.Sp
The \fB\-CC\fR option is generally used to support lint comments.
.IP "\fB\-P\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P"
Inhibit generation of linemarkers in the output from the preprocessor.
This might be useful when running the preprocessor on something that is
not C code, and will be sent to a program which might be confused by the
linemarkers.
.IP "\fB\-traditional\fR" 4

.IX Item "-traditional-cpp"
.PD
Try to imitate the behavior of pre-standard C preprocessors, as
opposed to \s-1ISO C\s0 preprocessors.
See the \s-1GNU CPP\s0 manual for details.
.Sp
Note that \s-1GCC\s0 does not otherwise attempt to emulate a pre-standard 
C compiler, and these options are only supported with the \fB\-E\fR 
switch, or when invoking \s-1CPP\s0 explicitly.
.IP "\fB\-trigraphs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-trigraphs"
Support \s-1ISO C\s0 trigraphs.
These are three-character sequences, all starting with \fB??\fR, that
are defined by \s-1ISO C\s0 to stand for single characters.  For example,
\&\fB??/\fR stands for \fB\e\fR, so \fB'??/n'\fR is a character
constant for a newline.
.Sp
The nine trigraphs and their replacements are
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&        Trigraph:       ??(  ??)  ??<  ??>  ??=  ??/  ??\*(Aq  ??!  ??\-
\&        Replacement:      [    ]    {    }    #    \e    ^    |    ~
.Ve
.Sp
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 ignores trigraphs, but in
standard-conforming modes it converts them.  See the \fB\-std\fR and
\&\fB\-ansi\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-remap\fR" 4
.IX Item "-remap"
Enable special code to work around file systems which only permit very
short file names, such as MS-DOS.
.IP "\fB\-H\fR" 4
.IX Item "-H"
Print the name of each header file used, in addition to other normal
activities.  Each name is indented to show how deep in the
\&\fB#include\fR stack it is.  Precompiled header files are also
printed, even if they are found to be invalid; an invalid precompiled
header file is printed with \fB...x\fR and a valid one with \fB...!\fR .
.IP "\fB\-d\fR\fIletters\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dletters"
Says to make debugging dumps during compilation as specified by
\&\fIletters\fR.  The flags documented here are those relevant to the
preprocessor.  Other \fIletters\fR are interpreted
by the compiler proper, or reserved for future versions of \s-1GCC,\s0 and so
are silently ignored.  If you specify \fIletters\fR whose behavior
conflicts, the result is undefined.
.RS 4
.IP "\fB\-dM\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dM"
Instead of the normal output, generate a list of \fB#define\fR
directives for all the macros defined during the execution of the
preprocessor, including predefined macros.  This gives you a way of
finding out what is predefined in your version of the preprocessor.
Assuming you have no file \fIfoo.h\fR, the command
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        touch foo.h; cpp \-dM foo.h
.Ve
.Sp
shows all the predefined macros.
.Sp
If you use \fB\-dM\fR without the \fB\-E\fR option, \fB\-dM\fR is
interpreted as a synonym for \fB\-fdump\-rtl\-mach\fR.
.IP "\fB\-dD\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dD"
Like \fB\-dM\fR except in two respects: it does \fInot\fR include the
predefined macros, and it outputs \fIboth\fR the \fB#define\fR
directives and the result of preprocessing.  Both kinds of output go to
the standard output file.
.IP "\fB\-dN\fR" 4

preprocessing.
.IP "\fB\-dU\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dU"
Like \fB\-dD\fR except that only macros that are expanded, or whose

\&\fIoption\fR contains commas, it is split into multiple options at the
commas.  However, many options are modified, translated or interpreted
by the compiler driver before being passed to the preprocessor, and
\&\fB\-Wp\fR forcibly bypasses this phase.  The preprocessor's direct
interface is undocumented and subject to change, so whenever possible
you should avoid using \fB\-Wp\fR and let the driver handle the
options instead.
.IP "\fB\-Xpreprocessor\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xpreprocessor option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the preprocessor.  You can use this to
supply system-specific preprocessor options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not 
recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes an argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xpreprocessor\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
.IP "\fB\-no\-integrated\-cpp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-integrated-cpp"
Perform preprocessing as a separate pass before compilation.
By default, \s-1GCC\s0 performs preprocessing as an integrated part of
input tokenization and parsing.
If this option is provided, the appropriate language front end
(\fBcc1\fR, \fBcc1plus\fR, or \fBcc1obj\fR for C, \*(C+,
and Objective-C, respectively) is instead invoked twice,
once for preprocessing only and once for actual compilation
of the preprocessed input.
This option may be useful in conjunction with the \fB\-B\fR or
\&\fB\-wrapper\fR options to specify an alternate preprocessor or
perform additional processing of the program source between
normal preprocessing and compilation.

.SS "Options for Linking"
.IX Subsection "Options for Linking"
These options come into play when the compiler links object files into
an executable output file.  They are meaningless if the compiler is
not doing a link step.
.IP "\fIobject-file-name\fR" 4
.IX Item "object-file-name"
A file name that does not end in a special recognized suffix is
considered to name an object file or library.  (Object files are
distinguished from libraries by the linker according to the file
contents.)  If linking is done, these object files are used as input
to the linker.
.IP "\fB\-c\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD
If any of these options is used, then the linker is not run, and
object file names should not be used as arguments.
.IP "\fB\-flinker\-output=\fR\fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flinker-output=type"
This option controls the code generation of the link time optimizer.  By
default the linker output is determined by the linker plugin automatically. For
debugging the compiler and in the case of incremental linking to non-lto object
file is desired, it may be useful to control the type manually.
.Sp
If \fItype\fR is \fBexec\fR the code generation is configured to produce static
binary. In this case \fB\-fpic\fR and \fB\-fpie\fR are both disabled.
.Sp
If \fItype\fR is \fBdyn\fR the code generation is configured to produce shared
library. In this case \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fPIC\fR is preserved, but not
enabled automatically.  This makes it possible to build shared libraries without
position independent code on architectures this is possible, i.e. on x86.
.Sp
If \fItype\fR is \fBpie\fR the code generation is configured to produce
\&\fB\-fpie\fR executable. This result in similar optimizations as \fBexec\fR
except that \fB\-fpie\fR is not disabled if specified at compilation time.
.Sp
If \fItype\fR is \fBrel\fR the compiler assumes that incremental linking is
done.  The sections containing intermediate code for link-time optimization are
merged, pre-optimized, and output to the resulting object file. In addition, if
\&\fB\-ffat\-lto\-objects\fR is specified the binary code is produced for future
non-lto linking. The object file produced by incremental linking will be smaller
than a static library produced from the same object files.  At link-time the
result of incremental linking will also load faster to compiler than a static
library assuming that majority of objects in the library are used.
.Sp
Finally \fBnolto-rel\fR configure compiler to for incremental linking where
code generation is forced, final binary is produced and the intermediate code
for later link-time optimization is stripped. When multiple object files are
linked together the resulting code will be optimized better than with link time
optimizations disabled (for example, the cross-module inlining will happen),
most of benefits of whole program optimizations are however lost.
.Sp
During the incremental link (by \fB\-r\fR) the linker plugin will default to
\&\fBrel\fR. With current interfaces to \s-1GNU\s0 Binutils it is however not
possible to link incrementally \s-1LTO\s0 objects and non-LTO objects into a single
mixed object file.  In the case any of object files in incremental link cannot
be used for link-time optimization the linker plugin will output warning and
use \fBnolto-rel\fR. To maintain the whole program optimization it is
recommended to link such objects into static library instead. Alternatively it
is possible to use H.J. Lu's binutils with support for mixed objects.
.IP "\fB\-fuse\-ld=bfd\fR" 4

.PD
Search the library named \fIlibrary\fR when linking.  (The second
alternative with the library as a separate argument is only for
\&\s-1POSIX\s0 compliance and is not recommended.)
.Sp
The \fB\-l\fR option is passed directly to the linker by \s-1GCC. \s0 Refer
to your linker documentation for exact details.  The general
description below applies to the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.
.Sp
The linker searches a standard list of directories for the library.
The directories searched include several standard system directories
plus any that you specify with \fB\-L\fR.
.Sp
Static libraries are archives of object files, and have file names
like \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.a\fR.  Some targets also support shared
libraries, which typically have names like \fIlib\fIlibrary\fI.so\fR.
If both static and shared libraries are found, the linker gives
preference to linking with the shared library unless the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is used.
.Sp
It makes a difference where in the command you write this option; the
linker searches and processes libraries and object files in the order they
are specified.  Thus, \fBfoo.o \-lz bar.o\fR searches library \fBz\fR
after file \fIfoo.o\fR but before \fIbar.o\fR.  If \fIbar.o\fR refers
to functions in \fBz\fR, those functions may not be loaded.
.IP "\fB\-lobjc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-lobjc"
You need this special case of the \fB\-l\fR option in order to
link an Objective-C or Objective\-\*(C+ program.
.IP "\fB\-nostartfiles\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostartfiles"
Do not use the standard system startup files when linking.
The standard system libraries are used normally, unless \fB\-nostdlib\fR,
\&\fB\-nolibc\fR, or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is used.
.IP "\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nodefaultlibs"
Do not use the standard system libraries when linking.
Only the libraries you specify are passed to the linker, and options
specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as \fB\-static\-libgcc\fR
or \fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, are ignored.  
The standard startup files are used normally, unless \fB\-nostartfiles\fR
is used.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.IP "\fB\-nolibc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nolibc"
Do not use the C library or system libraries tightly coupled with it when
linking.  Still link with the startup files, \fIlibgcc\fR or toolchain
provided language support libraries such as \fIlibgnat\fR, \fIlibgfortran\fR
or \fIlibstdc++\fR unless options preventing their inclusion are used as
well.  This typically removes \fB\-lc\fR from the link command line, as well
as system libraries that normally go with it and become meaningless when
absence of a C library is assumed, for example \fB\-lpthread\fR or
\&\fB\-lm\fR in some configurations.  This is intended for bare-board
targets when there is indeed no C library available.
.IP "\fB\-nostdlib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nostdlib"
Do not use the standard system startup files or libraries when linking.
No startup files and only the libraries you specify are passed to
the linker, and options specifying linkage of the system libraries, such as
\&\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR or \fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, are ignored.
.Sp
The compiler may generate calls to \f(CW\*(C`memcmp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`memset\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`memcpy\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`memmove\*(C'\fR.
These entries are usually resolved by entries in
libc.  These entry points should be supplied through some other
mechanism when this option is specified.
.Sp
One of the standard libraries bypassed by \fB\-nostdlib\fR and
\&\fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR is \fIlibgcc.a\fR, a library of internal subroutines
which \s-1GCC\s0 uses to overcome shortcomings of particular machines, or special
needs for some languages.
.Sp
In most cases, you need \fIlibgcc.a\fR even when you want to avoid
other standard libraries.  In other words, when you specify \fB\-nostdlib\fR
or \fB\-nodefaultlibs\fR you should usually specify \fB\-lgcc\fR as well.
This ensures that you have no unresolved references to internal \s-1GCC\s0
library subroutines.
(An example of such an internal subroutine is \f(CW\*(C`_\|_main\*(C'\fR, used to ensure \*(C+
constructors are called.)
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIentry\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-\-entry=\fR\fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "--entry=entry"
.PD
Specify that the program entry point is \fIentry\fR.  The argument is
interpreted by the linker; the \s-1GNU\s0 linker accepts either a symbol name
or an address.
.IP "\fB\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pie"
Produce a dynamically linked position independent executable on targets
that support it.  For predictable results, you must also specify the same
set of options used for compilation (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR,
or model suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
.IP "\fB\-no\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-pie"
Don't produce a dynamically linked position independent executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\-pie\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-pie"
Produce a static position independent executable on targets that support
it.  A static position independent executable is similar to a static
executable, but can be loaded at any address without a dynamic linker.
For predictable results, you must also specify the same set of options
used for compilation (\fB\-fpie\fR, \fB\-fPIE\fR, or model
suboptions) when you specify this linker option.
.IP "\fB\-pthread\fR" 4
.IX Item "-pthread"
Link with the \s-1POSIX\s0 threads library.  This option is supported on 
GNU/Linux targets, most other Unix derivatives, and also on 
x86 Cygwin and MinGW targets.  On some targets this option also sets 
flags for the preprocessor, so it should be used consistently for both
compilation and linking.
.IP "\fB\-r\fR" 4
.IX Item "-r"
Produce a relocatable object as output.  This is also known as partial
linking.
.IP "\fB\-rdynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rdynamic"
Pass the flag \fB\-export\-dynamic\fR to the \s-1ELF\s0 linker, on targets
that support it. This instructs the linker to add all symbols, not
only used ones, to the dynamic symbol table. This option is needed
for some uses of \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR or to allow obtaining backtraces
from within a program.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
Remove all symbol table and relocation information from the executable.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
On systems that support dynamic linking, this overrides \fB\-pie\fR
and prevents linking with the shared libraries.  On other systems, this
option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-shared\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared"
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to
form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For predictable
results, you must also specify the same set of options used for compilation
(\fB\-fpic\fR, \fB\-fPIC\fR, or model suboptions) when
you specify this linker option.[1]
.IP "\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-shared-libgcc"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-static\-libgcc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libgcc"
.PD
On systems that provide \fIlibgcc\fR as a shared library, these options
force the use of either the shared or static version, respectively.
If no shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR was built when the compiler was
configured, these options have no effect.
.Sp
There are several situations in which an application should use the
shared \fIlibgcc\fR instead of the static version.  The most common
of these is when the application wishes to throw and catch exceptions
across different shared libraries.  In that case, each of the libraries
as well as the application itself should use the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
.Sp
Therefore, the G++ driver automatically adds \fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR
whenever you build a shared library or a main executable, because \*(C+
programs typically use exceptions, so this is the right thing to do.
.Sp
If, instead, you use the \s-1GCC\s0 driver to create shared libraries, you may
find that they are not always linked with the shared \fIlibgcc\fR.
If \s-1GCC\s0 finds, at its configuration time, that you have a non-GNU linker
or a \s-1GNU\s0 linker that does not support option \fB\-\-eh\-frame\-hdr\fR,
it links the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR into shared libraries
by default.  Otherwise, it takes advantage of the linker and optimizes
away the linking with the shared version of \fIlibgcc\fR, linking with
the static version of libgcc by default.  This allows exceptions to
propagate through such shared libraries, without incurring relocation
costs at library load time.
.Sp
However, if a library or main executable is supposed to throw or catch
exceptions, you must link it using the G++ driver, or using the option
\&\fB\-shared\-libgcc\fR, such that it is linked with the shared
\&\fIlibgcc\fR.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libasan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libasan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=address\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibasan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibasan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibasan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libasan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibasan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libtsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libtsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=thread\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibtsan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibtsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibtsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libtsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibtsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-liblsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-liblsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=leak\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBliblsan\fR.  If
\&\fIliblsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIliblsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-liblsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIliblsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libubsan\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libubsan"
When the \fB\-fsanitize=undefined\fR option is used to link a program,
the \s-1GCC\s0 driver automatically links against \fBlibubsan\fR.  If
\&\fIlibubsan\fR is available as a shared library, and the \fB\-static\fR
option is not used, then this links against the shared version of
\&\fIlibubsan\fR.  The \fB\-static\-libubsan\fR option directs the \s-1GCC\s0
driver to link \fIlibubsan\fR statically, without necessarily linking
other libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static-libstdc++"
When the \fBg++\fR program is used to link a \*(C+ program, it
normally automatically links against \fBlibstdc++\fR.  If
\&\fIlibstdc++\fR is available as a shared library, and the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is not used, then this links against the
shared version of \fIlibstdc++\fR.  That is normally fine.  However, it
is sometimes useful to freeze the version of \fIlibstdc++\fR used by
the program without going all the way to a fully static link.  The
\&\fB\-static\-libstdc++\fR option directs the \fBg++\fR driver to
link \fIlibstdc++\fR statically, without necessarily linking other
libraries statically.
.IP "\fB\-symbolic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-symbolic"
Bind references to global symbols when building a shared object.  Warn
about any unresolved references (unless overridden by the link editor
option \fB\-Xlinker \-z \-Xlinker defs\fR).  Only a few systems support
this option.
.IP "\fB\-T\fR \fIscript\fR" 4
.IX Item "-T script"
Use \fIscript\fR as the linker script.  This option is supported by most
systems using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  On some targets, such as bare-board
targets without an operating system, the \fB\-T\fR option may be required
when linking to avoid references to undefined symbols.
.IP "\fB\-Xlinker\fR \fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Xlinker option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  You can use this to
supply system-specific linker options that \s-1GCC\s0 does not recognize.
.Sp
If you want to pass an option that takes a separate argument, you must use
\&\fB\-Xlinker\fR twice, once for the option and once for the argument.
For example, to pass \fB\-assert definitions\fR, you must write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-assert \-Xlinker definitions\fR.  It does not work to write
\&\fB\-Xlinker \*(L"\-assert definitions\*(R"\fR, because this passes the entire
string as a single argument, which is not what the linker expects.
.Sp
When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, it is usually more convenient to pass
arguments to linker options using the \fIoption\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR
syntax than as separate arguments.  For example, you can specify
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map=output.map\fR rather than
\&\fB\-Xlinker \-Map \-Xlinker output.map\fR.  Other linkers may not support
this syntax for command-line options.
.IP "\fB\-Wl,\fR\fIoption\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Wl,option"
Pass \fIoption\fR as an option to the linker.  If \fIoption\fR contains
commas, it is split into multiple options at the commas.  You can use this
syntax to pass an argument to the option.
For example, \fB\-Wl,\-Map,output.map\fR passes \fB\-Map output.map\fR to the
linker.  When using the \s-1GNU\s0 linker, you can also get the same effect with
\&\fB\-Wl,\-Map=output.map\fR.
.IP "\fB\-u\fR \fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "-u symbol"
Pretend the symbol \fIsymbol\fR is undefined, to force linking of

different symbols to force loading of additional library modules.
.IP "\fB\-z\fR \fIkeyword\fR" 4
.IX Item "-z keyword"
\&\fB\-z\fR is passed directly on to the linker along with the keyword
\&\fIkeyword\fR. See the section in the documentation of your linker for

You can use \fB\-I\fR to override a system header

However, you should
not use this option to add directories that contain vendor-supplied
system header files; use \fB\-isystem\fR for that.
.Sp
The \fB\-isystem\fR and \fB\-idirafter\fR options also mark the directory
as a system directory, so that it gets the same special treatment that
is applied to the standard system directories.
.Sp
If a standard system include directory, or a directory specified with
\&\fB\-isystem\fR, is also specified with \fB\-I\fR, the \fB\-I\fR
option is ignored.  The directory is still searched but as a
system directory at its normal position in the system include chain.
This is to ensure that \s-1GCC\s0's procedure to fix buggy system headers and
the ordering for the \f(CW\*(C`#include_next\*(C'\fR directive are not inadvertently
changed.

.IP "\fB\-L\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Ldir"
Add directory \fIdir\fR to the list of directories to be searched
for \fB\-l\fR.
.IP "\fB\-B\fR\fIprefix\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Bprefix"
This option specifies where to find the executables, libraries,
include files, and data files of the compiler itself.
.Sp
The compiler driver program runs one or more of the subprograms
\&\fBcpp\fR, \fBcc1\fR, \fBas\fR and \fBld\fR.  It tries
\&\fIprefix\fR as a prefix for each program it tries to run, both with and
without \fImachine\fR\fB/\fR\fIversion\fR\fB/\fR for the corresponding target
machine and compiler version.
.Sp
For each subprogram to be run, the compiler driver first tries the
\&\fB\-B\fR prefix, if any.  If that name is not found, or if \fB\-B\fR
is not specified, the driver tries two standard prefixes, 
\&\fI/usr/lib/gcc/\fR and \fI/usr/local/lib/gcc/\fR.  If neither of
those results in a file name that is found, the unmodified program
name is searched for using the directories specified in your
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR environment variable.
.Sp
The compiler checks to see if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR
refers to a directory, and if necessary it adds a directory
separator character at the end of the path.
.Sp
\&\fB\-B\fR prefixes that effectively specify directory names also apply
to libraries in the linker, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-L\fR options for the linker.  They also apply to
include files in the preprocessor, because the compiler translates these
options into \fB\-isystem\fR options for the preprocessor.  In this case,
the compiler appends \fBinclude\fR to the prefix.
.Sp
The runtime support file \fIlibgcc.a\fR can also be searched for using
the \fB\-B\fR prefix, if needed.  If it is not found there, the two
standard prefixes above are tried, and that is all.  The file is left
out of the link if it is not found by those means.
.Sp
Another way to specify a prefix much like the \fB\-B\fR prefix is to use
the environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.Sp
As a special kludge, if the path provided by \fB\-B\fR is
\&\fI[dir/]stage\fIN\fI/\fR, where \fIN\fR is a number in the range 0 to
9, then it is replaced by \fI[dir/]include\fR.  This is to help
with boot-strapping the compiler.
.IP "\fB\-no\-canonical\-prefixes\fR" 4
.IX Item "-no-canonical-prefixes"
Do not expand any symbolic links, resolve references to \fB/../\fR
or \fB/./\fR, or make the path absolute when generating a relative
prefix.
.IP "\fB\-\-sysroot=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "--sysroot=dir"
Use \fIdir\fR as the logical root directory for headers and libraries.
For example, if the compiler normally searches for headers in
\&\fI/usr/include\fR and libraries in \fI/usr/lib\fR, it instead
searches \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR and \fI\fIdir\fI/usr/lib\fR.
.Sp
If you use both this option and the \fB\-isysroot\fR option, then
the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option applies to libraries, but the
\&\fB\-isysroot\fR option applies to header files.
.Sp
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker (beginning with version 2.16) has the necessary support
for this option.  If your linker does not support this option, the
header file aspect of \fB\-\-sysroot\fR still works, but the
library aspect does not.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-sysroot\-suffix\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-sysroot-suffix"
For some targets, a suffix is added to the root directory specified
with \fB\-\-sysroot\fR, depending on the other options used, so that
headers may for example be found in
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/\fIsuffix\fI/usr/include\fR instead of
\&\fI\fIdir\fI/usr/include\fR.  This option disables the addition of
such a suffix.
.SS "Options for Code Generation Conventions"
.IX Subsection "Options for Code Generation Conventions"
These machine-independent options control the interface conventions
used in code generation.
.PP
Most of them have both positive and negative forms; the negative form
of \fB\-ffoo\fR is \fB\-fno\-foo\fR.  In the table below, only
one of the forms is listed\-\-\-the one that is not the default.  You
can figure out the other form by either removing \fBno\-\fR or adding
it.
.IP "\fB\-fstack\-reuse=\fR\fIreuse-level\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-reuse=reuse-level"
This option controls stack space reuse for user declared local/auto variables
and compiler generated temporaries.  \fIreuse_level\fR can be \fBall\fR,
\&\fBnamed_vars\fR, or \fBnone\fR. \fBall\fR enables stack reuse for all
local variables and temporaries, \fBnamed_vars\fR enables the reuse only for
user defined local variables with names, and \fBnone\fR disables stack reuse
completely. The default value is \fBall\fR. The option is needed when the
program extends the lifetime of a scoped local variable or a compiler generated
temporary beyond the end point defined by the language.  When a lifetime of
a variable ends, and if the variable lives in memory, the optimizing compiler
has the freedom to reuse its stack space with other temporaries or scoped
local variables whose live range does not overlap with it. Legacy code extending
local lifetime is likely to break with the stack reuse optimization.
.Sp
For example,
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&           int *p;
\&           {
\&             int local1;
\&        
\&             p = &local1;
\&             local1 = 10;
\&             ....
\&           }
\&           {
\&              int local2;
\&              local2 = 20;
\&              ...
\&           }
\&        
\&           if (*p == 10)  // out of scope use of local1
\&             {
\&        
\&             }
.Ve
.Sp
Another example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&           struct A
\&           {
\&               A(int k) : i(k), j(k) { }
\&               int i;
\&               int j;
\&           };
\&        
\&           A *ap;
\&        
\&           void foo(const A& ar)
\&           {
\&              ap = &ar;
\&           }
\&        
\&           void bar()
\&           {
\&              foo(A(10)); // temp object\*(Aqs lifetime ends when foo returns
\&        
\&              {
\&                A a(20);
\&                ....
\&              }
\&              ap\->i+= 10;  // ap references out of scope temp whose space
\&                           // is reused with a. What is the value of ap\->i?
\&           }
.Ve
.Sp
The lifetime of a compiler generated temporary is well defined by the \*(C+
standard. When a lifetime of a temporary ends, and if the temporary lives
in memory, the optimizing compiler has the freedom to reuse its stack
space with other temporaries or scoped local variables whose live range
does not overlap with it. However some of the legacy code relies on
the behavior of older compilers in which temporaries' stack space is
not reused, the aggressive stack reuse can lead to runtime errors. This
option is used to control the temporary stack reuse optimization.
.IP "\fB\-ftrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftrapv"
This option generates traps for signed overflow on addition, subtraction,
multiplication operations.
The options \fB\-ftrapv\fR and \fB\-fwrapv\fR override each other, so using
\&\fB\-ftrapv\fR \fB\-fwrapv\fR on the command-line results in
\&\fB\-fwrapv\fR being effective.  Note that only active options override, so
using \fB\-ftrapv\fR \fB\-fwrapv\fR \fB\-fno\-wrapv\fR on the command-line
results in \fB\-ftrapv\fR being effective.
.IP "\fB\-fwrapv\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwrapv"
This option instructs the compiler to assume that signed arithmetic
overflow of addition, subtraction and multiplication wraps around
using twos-complement representation.  This flag enables some optimizations
and disables others.
The options \fB\-ftrapv\fR and \fB\-fwrapv\fR override each other, so using

.IP "\fB\-fwrapv\-pointer\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fwrapv-pointer"
This option instructs the compiler to assume that pointer arithmetic
overflow on addition and subtraction wraps around using twos-complement
representation.  This flag disables some optimizations which assume
pointer overflow is invalid.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-overflow\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-overflow"
This option implies \fB\-fno\-wrapv\fR \fB\-fno\-wrapv\-pointer\fR and when
negated implies \fB\-fwrapv\fR \fB\-fwrapv\-pointer\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fexceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fexceptions"
Enable exception handling.  Generates extra code needed to propagate
exceptions.  For some targets, this implies \s-1GCC\s0 generates frame
unwind information for all functions, which can produce significant data
size overhead, although it does not affect execution.  If you do not
specify this option, \s-1GCC\s0 enables it by default for languages like
\&\*(C+ that normally require exception handling, and disables it for
languages like C that do not normally require it.  However, you may need
to enable this option when compiling C code that needs to interoperate
properly with exception handlers written in \*(C+.  You may also wish to
disable this option if you are compiling older \*(C+ programs that don't
use exception handling.
.IP "\fB\-fnon\-call\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fnon-call-exceptions"
Generate code that allows trapping instructions to throw exceptions.
Note that this requires platform-specific runtime support that does
not exist everywhere.  Moreover, it only allows \fItrapping\fR
instructions to throw exceptions, i.e. memory references or floating-point
instructions.  It does not allow exceptions to be thrown from
arbitrary signal handlers such as \f(CW\*(C`SIGALRM\*(C'\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fdelete\-dead\-exceptions\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdelete-dead-exceptions"
Consider that instructions that may throw exceptions but don't otherwise
contribute to the execution of the program can be optimized away.
This option is enabled by default for the Ada front end, as permitted by
the Ada language specification.
Optimization passes that cause dead exceptions to be removed are enabled independently at different optimization levels.
.IP "\fB\-funwind\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-funwind-tables"
Similar to \fB\-fexceptions\fR, except that it just generates any needed
static data, but does not affect the generated code in any other way.
You normally do not need to enable this option; instead, a language processor
that needs this handling enables it on your behalf.
.IP "\fB\-fasynchronous\-unwind\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fasynchronous-unwind-tables"
Generate unwind table in \s-1DWARF\s0 format, if supported by target machine.  The
table is exact at each instruction boundary, so it can be used for stack
unwinding from asynchronous events (such as debugger or garbage collector).
.IP "\fB\-fno\-gnu\-unique\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-gnu-unique"
On systems with recent \s-1GNU\s0 assembler and C library, the \*(C+ compiler
uses the \f(CW\*(C`STB_GNU_UNIQUE\*(C'\fR binding to make sure that definitions
of template static data members and static local variables in inline
functions are unique even in the presence of \f(CW\*(C`RTLD_LOCAL\*(C'\fR; this
is necessary to avoid problems with a library used by two different
\&\f(CW\*(C`RTLD_LOCAL\*(C'\fR plugins depending on a definition in one of them and
therefore disagreeing with the other one about the binding of the
symbol.  But this causes \f(CW\*(C`dlclose\*(C'\fR to be ignored for affected
DSOs; if your program relies on reinitialization of a \s-1DSO\s0 via
\&\f(CW\*(C`dlclose\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR, you can use
\&\fB\-fno\-gnu\-unique\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fpcc-struct-return"
Return \*(L"short\*(R" \f(CW\*(C`struct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`union\*(C'\fR values in memory like
longer ones, rather than in registers.  This convention is less
efficient, but it has the advantage of allowing intercallability between
GCC-compiled files and files compiled with other compilers, particularly
the Portable C Compiler (pcc).
.Sp
The precise convention for returning structures in memory depends
on the target configuration macros.
.Sp
Short structures and unions are those whose size and alignment match
that of some integer type.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR code compiled with the \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR
switch is not binary compatible with code compiled with the
\&\fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR switch.
Use it to conform to a non-default application binary interface.
.IP "\fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR" 4
.IX Item "-freg-struct-return"
Return \f(CW\*(C`struct\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`union\*(C'\fR values in registers when possible.
This is more efficient for small structures than
\&\fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR.
.Sp
If you specify neither \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR nor
\&\fB\-freg\-struct\-return\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 defaults to whichever convention is
standard for the target.  If there is no standard convention, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to \fB\-fpcc\-struct\-return\fR, except on targets where \s-1GCC\s0 is
the principal compiler.  In those cases, we can choose the standard, and
we chose the more efficient register return alternative.

.IP "\fB\-fshort\-enums\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fshort-enums"
Allocate to an \f(CW\*(C`enum\*(C'\fR type only as many bytes as it needs for the

.IX Item "-fshort-wchar"
Override the underlying type for \f(CW\*(C`wchar_t\*(C'\fR to be \f(CW\*(C`short
unsigned int\*(C'\fR instead of the default for the target.  This option is
useful for building programs to run under \s-1WINE.\s0

.IP "\fB\-fno\-common\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-common"
In C code, this option controls the placement of global variables 
defined without an initializer, known as \fItentative definitions\fR 
in the C standard.  Tentative definitions are distinct from declarations 
of a variable with the \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR keyword, which do not allocate storage.
.Sp
Unix C compilers have traditionally allocated storage for
uninitialized global variables in a common block.  This allows the
linker to resolve all tentative definitions of the same variable
in different compilation units to the same object, or to a non-tentative
definition.  
This is the behavior specified by \fB\-fcommon\fR, and is the default for 
\&\s-1GCC\s0 on most targets.  
On the other hand, this behavior is not required by \s-1ISO
C,\s0 and on some targets may carry a speed or code size penalty on
variable references.
.Sp
The \fB\-fno\-common\fR option specifies that the compiler should instead
place uninitialized global variables in the \s-1BSS\s0 section of the object file.
This inhibits the merging of tentative definitions by the linker so
you get a multiple-definition error if the same 
variable is defined in more than one compilation unit.
Compiling with \fB\-fno\-common\fR is useful on targets for which
it provides better performance, or if you wish to verify that the
program will work on other systems that always treat uninitialized
variable definitions this way.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-ident\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-ident"
Ignore the \f(CW\*(C`#ident\*(C'\fR directive.
.IP "\fB\-finhibit\-size\-directive\fR" 4
.IX Item "-finhibit-size-directive"
Don't output a \f(CW\*(C`.size\*(C'\fR assembler directive, or anything else that
would cause trouble if the function is split in the middle, and the
two halves are placed at locations far apart in memory.  This option is
used when compiling \fIcrtstuff.c\fR; you should not need to use it
for anything else.
.IP "\fB\-fverbose\-asm\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fverbose-asm"
Put extra commentary information in the generated assembly code to
make it more readable.  This option is generally only of use to those
who actually need to read the generated assembly code (perhaps while
debugging the compiler itself).
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-verbose\-asm\fR, the default, causes the
extra information to be omitted and is useful when comparing two assembler

Instead, load the callee address at call sites from the \s-1GOT\s0 and branch to it.
This leads to more efficient code by eliminating \s-1PLT\s0 stubs and exposing
\&\s-1GOT\s0 loads to optimizations.  On architectures such as 32\-bit x86 where
\&\s-1PLT\s0 stubs expect the \s-1GOT\s0 pointer in a specific register, this gives more
register allocation freedom to the compiler.
Lazy binding requires use of the \s-1PLT\s0; 
with \fB\-fno\-plt\fR all external symbols are resolved at load time.
.Sp
Alternatively, the function attribute \f(CW\*(C`noplt\*(C'\fR can be used to avoid calls
through the \s-1PLT\s0 for specific external functions.
.Sp
In position-dependent code, a few targets also convert calls to
functions that are marked to not use the \s-1PLT\s0 to use the \s-1GOT\s0 instead.
.IP "\fB\-fno\-jump\-tables\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fno-jump-tables"
Do not use jump tables for switch statements even where it would be
more efficient than other code generation strategies.  This option is
of use in conjunction with \fB\-fpic\fR or \fB\-fPIC\fR for
building code that forms part of a dynamic linker and cannot
reference the address of a jump table.  On some targets, jump tables
do not require a \s-1GOT\s0 and this option is not needed.
.IP "\fB\-ffixed\-\fR\fIreg\fR" 4

Treat the register named \fIreg\fR as a fixed register; generated code

pointer or in some other fixed role).
.Sp
\&\fIreg\fR must be the name of a register.  The register names accepted
are machine-specific and are defined in the \f(CW\*(C`REGISTER_NAMES\*(C'\fR

do not save and restore the register \fIreg\fR.
.Sp
It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.
.Sp
This flag does not have a negative form, because it specifies a
three-way choice.
.IP "\fB\-fcall\-saved\-\fR\fIreg\fR" 4

the register \fIreg\fR if they use it.
.Sp
It is an error to use this flag with the frame pointer or stack pointer.
Use of this flag for other registers that have fixed pervasive roles in
the machine's execution model produces disastrous results.
.Sp
A different sort of disaster results from the use of this flag for
a register in which function values may be returned.

.IP "\fB\-fpack\-struct[=\fR\fIn\fR\fB]\fR" 4

Without a value specified, pack all structure members together without
holes.  When a value is specified (which must be a small power of two), pack
structure members according to this value, representing the maximum
alignment (that is, objects with default alignment requirements larger than
this are output potentially unaligned at the next fitting location.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR the \fB\-fpack\-struct\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0 to generate

.IP "\fB\-ftls\-model=\fR\fImodel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftls-model=model"
Alter the thread-local storage model to be used.
The \fImodel\fR argument should be one of \fBglobal-dynamic\fR,
\&\fBlocal-dynamic\fR, \fBinitial-exec\fR or \fBlocal-exec\fR.
Note that the choice is subject to optimization: the compiler may use
a more efficient model for symbols not visible outside of the translation
unit, or if \fB\-fpic\fR is not given on the command line.
.Sp
The default without \fB\-fpic\fR is \fBinitial-exec\fR; with
\&\fB\-fpic\fR the default is \fBglobal-dynamic\fR.
.IP "\fB\-ftrampolines\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftrampolines"
For targets that normally need trampolines for nested functions, always
generate them instead of using descriptors.  Otherwise, for targets that
do not need them, like for example HP-PA or \s-1IA\-64,\s0 do nothing.
.Sp
A trampoline is a small piece of code that is created at run time on the
stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is used to call
the nested function indirectly.  Therefore, it requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fno\-trampolines\fR is enabled by default on a language by language
basis to let the compiler avoid generating them, if it computes that this
is safe, and replace them with descriptors.  Descriptors are made up of data
only, but the generated code must be prepared to deal with them.  As of this
writing, \fB\-fno\-trampolines\fR is enabled by default only for Ada.
.Sp
Moreover, code compiled with \fB\-ftrampolines\fR and code compiled with
\&\fB\-fno\-trampolines\fR are not binary compatible if nested functions are
present.  This option must therefore be used on a program-wide basis and be
manipulated with extreme care.
.IP "\fB\-fvisibility=\fR[\fBdefault\fR|\fBinternal\fR|\fBhidden\fR|\fBprotected\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-fvisibility=[default|internal|hidden|protected]"
Set the default \s-1ELF\s0 image symbol visibility to the specified option\-\-\-all
symbols are marked with this unless overridden within the code.
Using this feature can very substantially improve linking and
load times of shared object libraries, produce more optimized
code, provide near-perfect \s-1API\s0 export and prevent symbol clashes.
It is \fBstrongly\fR recommended that you use this in any shared objects
you distribute.
.Sp
Despite the nomenclature, \fBdefault\fR always means public; i.e.,
available to be linked against from outside the shared object.
\&\fBprotected\fR and \fBinternal\fR are pretty useless in real-world
usage so the only other commonly used option is \fBhidden\fR.
The default if \fB\-fvisibility\fR isn't specified is
\&\fBdefault\fR, i.e., make every symbol public.
.Sp
A good explanation of the benefits offered by ensuring \s-1ELF\s0
symbols have the correct visibility is given by \*(L"How To Write
Shared Libraries\*(R" by Ulrich Drepper (which can be found at
<\fBhttps://www.akkadia.org/drepper/\fR>)\-\-\-however a superior
solution made possible by this option to marking things hidden when
the default is public is to make the default hidden and mark things
public.  This is the norm with DLLs on Windows and with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute_\|_ ((visibility("default")))\*(C'\fR instead of
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllexport)\*(C'\fR you get almost identical semantics with
identical syntax.  This is a great boon to those working with
cross-platform projects.
.Sp
For those adding visibility support to existing code, you may find
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility\*(C'\fR of use.  This works by you enclosing
the declarations you wish to set visibility for with (for example)
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility push(hidden)\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility pop\*(C'\fR.
Bear in mind that symbol visibility should be viewed \fBas
part of the \s-1API\s0 interface contract\fR and thus all new code should
always specify visibility when it is not the default; i.e., declarations
only for use within the local \s-1DSO\s0 should \fBalways\fR be marked explicitly
as hidden as so to avoid \s-1PLT\s0 indirection overheads\-\-\-making this
abundantly clear also aids readability and self-documentation of the code.
Note that due to \s-1ISO \*(C+\s0 specification requirements, \f(CW\*(C`operator new\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`operator delete\*(C'\fR must always be of default visibility.
.Sp
Be aware that headers from outside your project, in particular system
headers and headers from any other library you use, may not be
expecting to be compiled with visibility other than the default.  You
may need to explicitly say \f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility push(default)\*(C'\fR
before including any such headers.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR declarations are not affected by \fB\-fvisibility\fR, so
a lot of code can be recompiled with \fB\-fvisibility=hidden\fR with
no modifications.  However, this means that calls to \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
functions with no explicit visibility use the \s-1PLT,\s0 so it is more
effective to use \f(CW\*(C`_\|_attribute ((visibility))\*(C'\fR and/or
\&\f(CW\*(C`#pragma GCC visibility\*(C'\fR to tell the compiler which \f(CW\*(C`extern\*(C'\fR
declarations should be treated as hidden.
.Sp
Note that \fB\-fvisibility\fR does affect \*(C+ vague linkage
entities. This means that, for instance, an exception class that is
be thrown between DSOs must be explicitly marked with default
visibility so that the \fBtype_info\fR nodes are unified between
the DSOs.
.Sp
An overview of these techniques, their benefits and how to use them
is at <\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/Visibility\fR>.
.IP "\fB\-fstrict\-volatile\-bitfields\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstrict-volatile-bitfields"
This option should be used if accesses to volatile bit-fields (or other
structure fields, although the compiler usually honors those types
anyway) should use a single access of the width of the
field's type, aligned to a natural alignment if possible.  For
example, targets with memory-mapped peripheral registers might require
all such accesses to be 16 bits wide; with this flag you can
declare all peripheral bit-fields as \f(CW\*(C`unsigned short\*(C'\fR (assuming short
is 16 bits on these targets) to force \s-1GCC\s0 to use 16\-bit accesses
instead of, perhaps, a more efficient 32\-bit access.
.Sp
If this option is disabled, the compiler uses the most efficient
instruction.  In the previous example, that might be a 32\-bit load
instruction, even though that accesses bytes that do not contain
any portion of the bit-field, or memory-mapped registers unrelated to
the one being updated.
.Sp
In some cases, such as when the \f(CW\*(C`packed\*(C'\fR attribute is applied to a 
structure field, it may not be possible to access the field with a single
read or write that is correctly aligned for the target machine.  In this
case \s-1GCC\s0 falls back to generating multiple accesses rather than code that 
will fault or truncate the result at run time.
.Sp
Note:  Due to restrictions of the C/\*(C+11 memory model, write accesses are
not allowed to touch non bit-field members.  It is therefore recommended
to define all bits of the field's type as bit-field members.
.Sp
The default value of this option is determined by the application binary
interface for the target processor.
.IP "\fB\-fsync\-libcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fsync-libcalls"
This option controls whether any out-of-line instance of the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_sync\*(C'\fR
family of functions may be used to implement the \*(C+11 \f(CW\*(C`_\|_atomic\*(C'\fR
family of functions.
.Sp
The default value of this option is enabled, thus the only useful form
of the option is \fB\-fno\-sync\-libcalls\fR.  This option is used in
the implementation of the \fIlibatomic\fR runtime library.
.SS "\s-1GCC\s0 Developer Options"
.IX Subsection "GCC Developer Options"
This section describes command-line options that are primarily of
interest to \s-1GCC\s0 developers, including options to support compiler
testing and investigation of compiler bugs and compile-time
performance problems.  This includes options that produce debug dumps
at various points in the compilation; that print statistics such as
memory use and execution time; and that print information about \s-1GCC\s0's
configuration, such as where it searches for libraries.  You should
rarely need to use any of these options for ordinary compilation and
linking tasks.
.PP
Many developer options that cause \s-1GCC\s0 to dump output to a file take an
optional \fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR suffix. You can specify \fBstdout\fR
or \fB\-\fR to dump to standard output, and \fBstderr\fR for standard
error.
.PP
If \fB=\fR\fIfilename\fR is omitted, a default dump file name is
constructed by concatenating the base dump file name, a pass number,
phase letter, and pass name.  The base dump file name is the name of
output file produced by the compiler if explicitly specified and not
an executable; otherwise it is the source file name.
The pass number is determined by the order passes are registered with
the compiler's pass manager. 
This is generally the same as the order of execution, but passes
registered by plugins, target-specific passes, or passes that are
otherwise registered late are numbered higher than the pass named
\&\fBfinal\fR, even if they are executed earlier.  The phase letter is
one of \fBi\fR (inter-procedural analysis), \fBl\fR
(language-specific), \fBr\fR (\s-1RTL\s0), or \fBt\fR (tree). 
The files are created in the directory of the output file.

To determine what tree dumps are available or find the dump for a pass
of interest follow the steps below.
.IP "1." 4
.IX Item "1."
Invoke \s-1GCC\s0 with \fB\-fdump\-passes\fR and in the \fIstderr\fR output
look for a code that corresponds to the pass you are interested in.
For example, the codes \f(CW\*(C`tree\-evrp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`tree\-vrp1\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`tree\-vrp2\*(C'\fR correspond to the three Value Range Propagation passes.
The number at the end distinguishes distinct invocations of the same pass.
.IP "2." 4
.IX Item "2."
To enable the creation of the dump file, append the pass code to
the \fB\-fdump\-\fR option prefix and invoke \s-1GCC\s0 with it.  For example,
to enable the dump from the Early Value Range Propagation pass, invoke
\&\s-1GCC\s0 with the \fB\-fdump\-tree\-evrp\fR option.  Optionally, you may
specify the name of the dump file.  If you don't specify one, \s-1GCC\s0
creates as described below.
.IP "3." 4
.IX Item "3."
Find the pass dump in a file whose name is composed of three components
separated by a period: the name of the source file \s-1GCC\s0 was invoked to
compile, a numeric suffix indicating the pass number followed by the
letter \fBt\fR for tree passes (and the letter \fBr\fR for \s-1RTL\s0 passes),
and finally the pass code.  For example, the Early \s-1VRP\s0 pass dump might
be in a file named \fImyfile.c.038t.evrp\fR in the current working
directory.  Note that the numeric codes are not stable and may change
from one version of \s-1GCC\s0 to another.

If \fIoptions\fR is
omitted, it defaults to \fBoptimized-optall\fR, which means to dump messages
about successful optimizations from all the passes, omitting messages
that are treated as \*(L"internals\*(R".
.Sp
If the \fIfilename\fR is provided, then the dumps from all the
applicable optimizations are concatenated into the \fIfilename\fR.
Otherwise the dump is output onto \fIstderr\fR. Though multiple
\&\fB\-fopt\-info\fR options are accepted, only one of them can include
a \fIfilename\fR. If other filenames are provided then all but the
first such option are ignored.
.Sp
Note that the output \fIfilename\fR is overwritten
in case of multiple translation units. If a combined output from
multiple translation units is desired, \fIstderr\fR should be used
instead.
.Sp
In the following example, the optimization info is output to
\&\fIstderr\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info
.Ve
.Sp
This example:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info\-missed=missed.all
.Ve
.Sp
outputs missed optimization report from all the passes into
\&\fImissed.all\fR, and this one:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O2 \-ftree\-vectorize \-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed
.Ve
.Sp
prints information about missed optimization opportunities from
vectorization passes on \fIstderr\fR.  
Note that \fB\-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed\fR is equivalent to 
\&\fB\-fopt\-info\-missed\-vec\fR.  The order of the optimization group
names and message types listed after \fB\-fopt\-info\fR does not matter.
.Sp
As another example,
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-O3 \-fopt\-info\-inline\-optimized\-missed=inline.txt
.Ve
.Sp
outputs information about missed optimizations as well as
optimized locations from all the inlining passes into
\&\fIinline.txt\fR.
.Sp
Finally, consider:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        gcc \-fopt\-info\-vec\-missed=vec.miss \-fopt\-info\-loop\-optimized=loop.opt
.Ve
.Sp
Here the two output filenames \fIvec.miss\fR and \fIloop.opt\fR are
in conflict since only one output file is allowed. In this case, only
the first option takes effect and the subsequent options are
ignored. Thus only \fIvec.miss\fR is produced which contains
dumps from the vectorizer about missed opportunities.

each message:
.RS 4

Store the usual \*(L"temporary\*(R" intermediate files permanently; place them
in the current directory and name them based on the source file.  Thus,
compiling \fIfoo.c\fR with \fB\-c \-save\-temps\fR produces files
\&\fIfoo.i\fR and \fIfoo.s\fR, as well as \fIfoo.o\fR.  This creates a
preprocessed \fIfoo.i\fR output file even though the compiler now
normally uses an integrated preprocessor.
.Sp
When used in combination with the \fB\-x\fR command-line option,
\&\fB\-save\-temps\fR is sensible enough to avoid over writing an
input source file with the same extension as an intermediate file.
The corresponding intermediate file may be obtained by renaming the
source file before using \fB\-save\-temps\fR.
.Sp
If you invoke \s-1GCC\s0 in parallel, compiling several different source
files that share a common base name in different subdirectories or the
same source file compiled for multiple output destinations, it is
likely that the different parallel compilers will interfere with each
other, and overwrite the temporary files.  For instance:
.Sp
.Vb 2

The first number on each line is the \*(L"user time\*(R", that is time spent
executing the program itself.  The second number is \*(L"system time\*(R",
time spent executing operating system routines on behalf of the program.
Both numbers are in seconds.
.Sp
With the specification of an output file, the output is appended to the
named file, and it looks like this:

\&        0.00 0.01 as <options>
.Ve
.Sp
The \*(L"user time\*(R" and the \*(L"system time\*(R" are moved before the program
name, and the options passed to the program are displayed, so that one
can later tell what file was being compiled, and with which options.
.IP "\fB\-fdump\-final\-insns\fR[\fB=\fR\fIfile\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-fdump-final-insns[=file]"
Dump the final internal representation (\s-1RTL\s0) to \fIfile\fR.  If the
optional argument is omitted (or if \fIfile\fR is \f(CW\*(C`.\*(C'\fR), the name
of the dump file is determined by appending \f(CW\*(C`.gkd\*(C'\fR to the
compilation output file name.
.IP "\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR[\fB=\fR\fIopts\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-fcompare-debug[=opts]"
If no error occurs during compilation, run the compiler a second time,
adding \fIopts\fR and \fB\-fcompare\-debug\-second\fR to the arguments
passed to the second compilation.  Dump the final internal
representation in both compilations, and print an error if they differ.
.Sp
If the equal sign is omitted, the default \fB\-gtoggle\fR is used.
.Sp
The environment variable \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR, if defined, non-empty
and nonzero, implicitly enables \fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR.  If
\&\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR is defined to a string starting with a dash,
then it is used for \fIopts\fR, otherwise the default \fB\-gtoggle\fR
is used.
.Sp
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug=\fR, with the equal sign but without \fIopts\fR,
is equivalent to \fB\-fno\-compare\-debug\fR, which disables the dumping
of the final representation and the second compilation, preventing even
\&\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR from taking effect.
.Sp
To verify full coverage during \fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR testing, set
\&\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR to say \fB\-fcompare\-debug\-not\-overridden\fR,
which \s-1GCC\s0 rejects as an invalid option in any actual compilation
(rather than preprocessing, assembly or linking).  To get just a
warning, setting \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR to \fB\-w%n\-fcompare\-debug
not overridden\fR will do.
.IP "\fB\-fcompare\-debug\-second\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fcompare-debug-second"
This option is implicitly passed to the compiler for the second
compilation requested by \fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR, along with options to
silence warnings, and omitting other options that would cause the compiler
to produce output to files or to standard output as a side effect.  Dump
files and preserved temporary files are renamed so as to contain the
\&\f(CW\*(C`.gk\*(C'\fR additional extension during the second compilation, to avoid
overwriting those generated by the first.
.Sp
When this option is passed to the compiler driver, it causes the
\&\fIfirst\fR compilation to be skipped, which makes it useful for little
other than debugging the compiler proper.
.IP "\fB\-gtoggle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gtoggle"
Turn off generation of debug info, if leaving out this option
generates it, or turn it on at level 2 otherwise.  The position of this
argument in the command line does not matter; it takes effect after all
other options are processed, and it does so only once, no matter how
many times it is given.  This is mainly intended to be used with
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR.
.IP "\fB\-fvar\-tracking\-assignments\-toggle\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fvar-tracking-assignments-toggle"
Toggle \fB\-fvar\-tracking\-assignments\fR, in the same way that
\&\fB\-gtoggle\fR toggles \fB\-g\fR.

.IX Item "-Q"
Makes the compiler print out each function name as it is compiled, and
print some statistics about each pass when it finishes.
.IP "\fB\-ftime\-report\fR" 4
.IX Item "-ftime-report"

The default value is 5.  If the value \fIn\fR is greater or equal to 10,
the dump output is sent to stderr using the same format as \fIn\fR minus 10.
.IP "\fB\-flto\-report\fR" 4
.IX Item "-flto-report"
Prints a report with internal details on the workings of the link-time

It is meant to be useful to \s-1GCC\s0 developers when processing object

.IP "\fB\-fstack\-usage\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstack-usage"
Makes the compiler output stack usage information for the program, on a
per-function basis.  The filename for the dump is made by appending
\&\fI.su\fR to the \fIauxname\fR.  \fIauxname\fR is generated from the name of
the output file, if explicitly specified and it is not an executable,
otherwise it is the basename of the source file.  An entry is made up
of three fields:
.RS 4
.IP "*" 4
The name of the function.
.IP "*" 4
A number of bytes.
.IP "*" 4
One or more qualifiers: \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bounded\*(C'\fR.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`static\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
statically: a fixed number of bytes are allocated for the frame on function
entry and released on function exit; no stack adjustments are otherwise made
in the function.  The second field is this fixed number of bytes.
.Sp
The qualifier \f(CW\*(C`dynamic\*(C'\fR means that the function manipulates the stack
dynamically: in addition to the static allocation described above, stack
adjustments are made in the body of the function, for example to push/pop
arguments around function calls.  If the qualifier \f(CW\*(C`bounded\*(C'\fR is also
present, the amount of these adjustments is bounded at compile time and
the second field is an upper bound of the total amount of stack used by
the function.  If it is not present, the amount of these adjustments is
not bounded at compile time and the second field only represents the
bounded part.
.RE
.IP "\fB\-fstats\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fstats"
Emit statistics about front-end processing at the end of the compilation.
This option is supported only by the \*(C+ front end, and
the information is generally only useful to the G++ development team.
.IP "\fB\-fdbg\-cnt\-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdbg-cnt-list"
Print the name and the counter upper bound for all debug counters.
.IP "\fB\-fdbg\-cnt=\fR\fIcounter-value-list\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fdbg-cnt=counter-value-list"
Set the internal debug counter lower and upper bound.  \fIcounter-value-list\fR
is a comma-separated list of \fIname\fR:\fIlower_bound\fR:\fIupper_bound\fR
tuples which sets the lower and the upper bound of each debug
counter \fIname\fR.  The \fIlower_bound\fR is optional and is zero
initialized if not set.
All debug counters have the initial upper bound of \f(CW\*(C`UINT_MAX\*(C'\fR;
thus \f(CW\*(C`dbg_cnt\*(C'\fR returns true always unless the upper bound
is set by this option.
For example, with \fB\-fdbg\-cnt=dce:2:4,tail_call:10\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`dbg_cnt(dce)\*(C'\fR returns true only for third and fourth invocation.
For \f(CW\*(C`dbg_cnt(tail_call)\*(C'\fR true is returned for first 10 invocations.
.IP "\fB\-print\-file\-name=\fR\fIlibrary\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-file-name=library"
Print the full absolute name of the library file \fIlibrary\fR that
would be used when linking\-\-\-and don't do anything else.  With this
option, \s-1GCC\s0 does not compile or link anything; it just prints the
file name.
.IP "\fB\-print\-multi\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-multi-directory"
Print the directory name corresponding to the multilib selected by any
other switches present in the command line.  This directory is supposed
to exist in \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\-print\-multi\-lib\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-multi-lib"
Print the mapping from multilib directory names to compiler switches
that enable them.  The directory name is separated from the switches by
\&\fB;\fR, and each switch starts with an \fB@\fR instead of the
\&\fB\-\fR, without spaces between multiple switches.  This is supposed to
ease shell processing.
.IP "\fB\-print\-multi\-os\-directory\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-multi-os-directory"
Print the path to \s-1OS\s0 libraries for the selected
multilib, relative to some \fIlib\fR subdirectory.  If \s-1OS\s0 libraries are
present in the \fIlib\fR subdirectory and no multilibs are used, this is
usually just \fI.\fR, if \s-1OS\s0 libraries are present in \fIlib\fIsuffix\fI\fR
sibling directories this prints e.g. \fI../lib64\fR, \fI../lib\fR or
\&\fI../lib32\fR, or if \s-1OS\s0 libraries are present in \fIlib/\fIsubdir\fI\fR
subdirectories it prints e.g. \fIamd64\fR, \fIsparcv9\fR or \fIev6\fR.
.IP "\fB\-print\-multiarch\fR" 4

.Sp
This is useful when \fBgcc\fR prints the error message
\&\fBinstallation problem, cannot exec cpp0: No such file or directory\fR.
To resolve this you either need to put \fIcpp0\fR and the other compiler
components where \fBgcc\fR expects to find them, or you can set the environment

Don't forget the trailing \fB/\fR.
.IP "\fB\-print\-sysroot\fR" 4
.IX Item "-print-sysroot"
Print the target sysroot directory that is used during
compilation.  This is the target sysroot specified either at configure
time or using the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option, possibly with an extra
suffix that depends on compilation options.  If no target sysroot is
specified, the option prints nothing.
.IP "\fB\-print\-sysroot\-headers\-suffix\fR" 4

.IX Item "-dumpversion"
Print the compiler version (for example, \f(CW3.0\fR, \f(CW6.3.0\fR or \f(CW7\fR)\-\-\-and don't do
anything else.  This is the compiler version used in filesystem paths and

but long int and pointers are 64 bits.
.Sp
The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the \s-1LP64\s0 and \s-1ILP32\s0 ABIs are not link-compatible; you must compile your
entire program with the same \s-1ABI,\s0 and link with a compatible set of libraries.

Additionally on native AArch64 GNU/Linux systems the value

\&\s-1GCC\s0 uses \fIname\fR to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when
generating assembly code (as if by \fB\-march\fR) and to determine
the target processor for which to tune for performance (as if

Specify the number of bits in an \s-1SVE\s0 vector register.  This option only has
an effect when \s-1SVE\s0 is enabled.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports two forms of \s-1SVE\s0 code generation: \*(L"vector-length
agnostic\*(R" output that works with any size of vector register and
\&\*(L"vector-length specific\*(R" output that allows \s-1GCC\s0 to make assumptions
about the vector length when it is useful for optimization reasons.
The possible values of \fBbits\fR are: \fBscalable\fR, \fB128\fR,
\&\fB256\fR, \fB512\fR, \fB1024\fR and \fB2048\fR.
Specifying \fBscalable\fR selects vector-length agnostic
output.  At present \fB\-msve\-vector\-bits=128\fR also generates vector-length
agnostic output.  All other values generate vector-length specific code.
The behavior of these values may change in future releases and no value except
\&\fBscalable\fR should be relied on for producing code that is portable across
different hardware \s-1SVE\s0 vector lengths.

The default is \fB\-msve\-vector\-bits=scalable\fR, which produces
vector-length agnostic code.

.IX Subsection "Adapteva Epiphany Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for Adapteva Epiphany:
.IP "\fB\-mhalf\-reg\-file\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhalf-reg-file"
Don't allocate any register in the range \f(CW\*(C`r32\*(C'\fR...\f(CW\*(C`r63\*(C'\fR.
That allows code to run on hardware variants that lack these registers.
.IP "\fB\-mprefer\-short\-insn\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mprefer-short-insn-regs"
Preferentially allocate registers that allow short instruction generation.
This can result in increased instruction count, so this may either reduce or
increase overall code size.
.IP "\fB\-mbranch\-cost=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbranch-cost=num"
Set the cost of branches to roughly \fInum\fR \*(L"simple\*(R" instructions.
This cost is only a heuristic and is not guaranteed to produce
consistent results across releases.
.IP "\fB\-mcmove\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcmove"
Enable the generation of conditional moves.
.IP "\fB\-mnops=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mnops=num"
Emit \fInum\fR NOPs before every other generated instruction.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-soft\-cmpsf\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-soft-cmpsf"
For single-precision floating-point comparisons, emit an \f(CW\*(C`fsub\*(C'\fR instruction
and test the flags.  This is faster than a software comparison, but can
get incorrect results in the presence of NaNs, or when two different small
numbers are compared such that their difference is calculated as zero.
The default is \fB\-msoft\-cmpsf\fR, which uses slower, but IEEE-compliant,
software comparisons.
.IP "\fB\-mstack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstack-offset=num"
Set the offset between the top of the stack and the stack pointer.
E.g., a value of 8 means that the eight bytes in the range \f(CW\*(C`sp+0...sp+7\*(C'\fR
can be used by leaf functions without stack allocation.
Values other than \fB8\fR or \fB16\fR are untested and unlikely to work.
Note also that this option changes the \s-1ABI\s0; compiling a program with a
different stack offset than the libraries have been compiled with
generally does not work.
This option can be useful if you want to evaluate if a different stack
offset would give you better code, but to actually use a different stack
offset to build working programs, it is recommended to configure the
toolchain with the appropriate \fB\-\-with\-stack\-offset=\fR\fInum\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-round\-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-round-nearest"
Make the scheduler assume that the rounding mode has been set to
truncating.  The default is \fB\-mround\-nearest\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all calls might be beyond
the offset range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, and therefore load the
function address into a register before performing a (otherwise direct) call.
This is the default.
.IP "\fB\-mshort\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mshort-calls"
If not otherwise specified by an attribute, assume all direct calls are
in the range of the \f(CW\*(C`b\*(C'\fR / \f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instructions, so use these instructions
for direct calls.  The default is \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR.
.IP "\fB\-msmall16\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msmall16"
Assume addresses can be loaded as 16\-bit unsigned values.  This does not
apply to function addresses for which \fB\-mlong\-calls\fR semantics
are in effect.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-mode=\fR\fImode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-mode=mode"
Set the prevailing mode of the floating-point unit.
This determines the floating-point mode that is provided and expected
at function call and return time.  Making this mode match the mode you
predominantly need at function start can make your programs smaller and
faster by avoiding unnecessary mode switches.
.Sp
\&\fImode\fR can be set to one the following values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBcaller\fR" 4
.IX Item "caller"
Any mode at function entry is valid, and retained or restored when
the function returns, and when it calls other functions.
This mode is useful for compiling libraries or other compilation units
you might want to incorporate into different programs with different
prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 modes, and the convenience of being able to use a single
object file outweighs the size and speed overhead for any extra
mode switching that might be needed, compared with what would be needed
with a more specific choice of prevailing \s-1FPU\s0 mode.
.IP "\fBtruncate\fR" 4
.IX Item "truncate"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
truncating (i.e. round towards zero) rounding mode.  That includes
conversion from floating point to integer.
.IP "\fBround-nearest\fR" 4
.IX Item "round-nearest"
This is the mode used for floating-point calculations with
round-to-nearest-or-even rounding mode.

.IP "\fB\-mno\-cond\-exec\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-cond-exec"
Disable the ARCompact-specific pass to generate conditional 
execution instructions.
.Sp
Due to delay slot scheduling and interactions between operand numbers,
literal sizes, instruction lengths, and the support for conditional execution,
the target-independent pass to generate conditional execution is often lacking,
so the \s-1ARC\s0 port has kept a special pass around that tries to find more
conditional execution generation opportunities after register allocation,
branch shortening, and delay slot scheduling have been done.  This pass
generally, but not always, improves performance and code size, at the cost of
extra compilation time, which is why there is an option to switch it off.
If you have a problem with call instructions exceeding their allowable
offset range because they are conditionalized, you should consider using
\&\fB\-mmedium\-calls\fR instead.

.IP "\fB\-mmillicode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmillicode"
When optimizing for size (using \fB\-Os\fR), prologues and epilogues
that have to save or restore a large number of registers are often
shortened by using call to a special function in libgcc; this is
referred to as a \fImillicode\fR call.  As these calls can pose
performance issues, and/or cause linking issues when linking in a
nonstandard way, this option is provided to turn on or off millicode
call generation.

\fI\s-1ARM\s0 Options\fR
.IX Subsection "ARM Options"
.PP
These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for the \s-1ARM\s0 port:
.IP "\fB\-mabi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabi=name"
Generate code for the specified \s-1ABI. \s0 Permissible values are: \fBapcs-gnu\fR,
\&\fBatpcs\fR, \fBaapcs\fR, \fBaapcs-linux\fR and \fBiwmmxt\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs-frame"
Generate a stack frame that is compliant with the \s-1ARM\s0 Procedure Call
Standard for all functions, even if this is not strictly necessary for
correct execution of the code.  Specifying \fB\-fomit\-frame\-pointer\fR
with this option causes the stack frames not to be generated for
leaf functions.  The default is \fB\-mno\-apcs\-frame\fR.
This option is deprecated.
.IP "\fB\-mapcs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mapcs"
This is a synonym for \fB\-mapcs\-frame\fR and is deprecated.
.IP "\fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mthumb-interwork"
Generate code that supports calling between the \s-1ARM\s0 and Thumb
instruction sets.  Without this option, on pre\-v5 architectures, the
two instruction sets cannot be reliably used inside one program.  The
default is \fB\-mno\-thumb\-interwork\fR, since slightly larger code
is generated when \fB\-mthumb\-interwork\fR is specified.  In \s-1AAPCS\s0
configurations this option is meaningless.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-sched\-prolog\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-sched-prolog"
Prevent the reordering of instructions in the function prologue, or the
merging of those instruction with the instructions in the function's
body.  This means that all functions start with a recognizable set
of instructions (or in fact one of a choice from a small set of
different function prologues), and this information can be used to
locate the start of functions inside an executable piece of code.  The
default is \fB\-msched\-prolog\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfloat\-abi=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfloat-abi=name"
Specifies which floating-point \s-1ABI\s0 to use.  Permissible values
are: \fBsoft\fR, \fBsoftfp\fR and \fBhard\fR.
.Sp
Specifying \fBsoft\fR causes \s-1GCC\s0 to generate output containing
library calls for floating-point operations.
\&\fBsoftfp\fR allows the generation of code using hardware floating-point
instructions, but still uses the soft-float calling conventions.
\&\fBhard\fR allows generation of floating-point instructions
and uses FPU-specific calling conventions.
.Sp
The default depends on the specific target configuration.  Note that
the hard-float and soft-float ABIs are not link-compatible; you must
compile your entire program with the same \s-1ABI,\s0 and link with a
compatible set of libraries.
.IP "\fB\-mgeneral\-regs\-only\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgeneral-regs-only"
Generate code which uses only the general-purpose registers.  This will prevent
the compiler from using floating-point and Advanced \s-1SIMD\s0 registers but will not
impose any restrictions on the assembler.
.IP "\fB\-mlittle\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlittle-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in little-endian mode.  This is
the default for all standard configurations.
.IP "\fB\-mbig\-endian\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbig-endian"
Generate code for a processor running in big-endian mode; the default is
to compile code for a little-endian processor.
.IP "\fB\-mbe8\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbe8"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mbe32\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mbe32"
.PD
When linking a big-endian image select between \s-1BE8\s0 and \s-1BE32\s0 formats.
The option has no effect for little-endian images and is ignored.  The
default is dependent on the selected target architecture.  For ARMv6
and later architectures the default is \s-1BE8,\s0 for older architectures
the default is \s-1BE32.  BE32\s0 format has been deprecated by \s-1ARM.\s0
.IP "\fB\-march=\fR\fIname\fR[\fB+extension...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-march=name[+extension...]"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this
name to determine what kind of instructions it can emit when generating
assembly code.  This option can be used in conjunction with or instead
of the \fB\-mcpu=\fR option.
.Sp
Permissible names are:
\&\fBarmv4t\fR,
\&\fBarmv5t\fR, \fBarmv5te\fR,
\&\fBarmv6\fR, \fBarmv6j\fR, \fBarmv6k\fR, \fBarmv6kz\fR, \fBarmv6t2\fR,
\&\fBarmv6z\fR, \fBarmv6zk\fR,
\&\fBarmv7\fR, \fBarmv7\-a\fR, \fBarmv7ve\fR, 
\&\fBarmv8\-a\fR, \fBarmv8.1\-a\fR, \fBarmv8.2\-a\fR, \fBarmv8.3\-a\fR,
\&\fBarmv8.4\-a\fR,
\&\fBarmv8.5\-a\fR,
\&\fBarmv7\-r\fR,
\&\fBarmv8\-r\fR,
\&\fBarmv6\-m\fR, \fBarmv6s\-m\fR,
\&\fBarmv7\-m\fR, \fBarmv7e\-m\fR,
\&\fBarmv8\-m.base\fR, \fBarmv8\-m.main\fR,
\&\fBiwmmxt\fR and \fBiwmmxt2\fR.
.Sp
Additionally, the following architectures, which lack support for the
Thumb execution state, are recognized but support is deprecated: \fBarmv4\fR.
.Sp
Many of the architectures support extensions.  These can be added by
appending \fB+\fR\fIextension\fR to the architecture name.  Extension
options are processed in order and capabilities accumulate.  An extension
will also enable any necessary base extensions
upon which it depends.  For example, the \fB+crypto\fR extension
will always enable the \fB+simd\fR extension.  The exception to the
additive construction is for extensions that are prefixed with
\&\fB+no...\fR: these extensions disable the specified option and
any other extensions that may depend on the presence of that
extension.
.Sp
For example, \fB\-march=armv7\-a+simd+nofp+vfpv4\fR is equivalent to
writing \fB\-march=armv7\-a+vfpv4\fR since the \fB+simd\fR option is
entirely disabled by the \fB+nofp\fR option that follows it.
.Sp
Most extension names are generically named, but have an effect that is
dependent upon the architecture to which it is applied.  For example,
the \fB+simd\fR option can be applied to both \fBarmv7\-a\fR and
\&\fBarmv8\-a\fR architectures, but will enable the original ARMv7\-A
Advanced \s-1SIMD \s0(Neon) extensions for \fBarmv7\-a\fR and the ARMv8\-A
variant for \fBarmv8\-a\fR.
.Sp
The table below lists the supported extensions for each architecture.
Architectures not mentioned do not support any extensions.

\&\fB\-mtune=generic\-\fR\fIarch\fR specifies that \s-1GCC\s0 should tune the
performance for a blend of processors within architecture \fIarch\fR.
The aim is to generate code that run well on the current most popular
processors, balancing between optimizations that benefit some CPUs in the

this option may change in future \s-1GCC\s0 versions as \s-1CPU\s0 models come and go.

\&\fB\-mtune\fR permits the same extension options as \fB\-mcpu\fR, but
the extension options do not affect the tuning of the generated code.

\&\fB\-mtune=native\fR causes the compiler to auto-detect the \s-1CPU\s0

unsuccessful the option has no effect.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR\fIname\fR[\fB+extension...\fR]" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu=name[+extension...]"
This specifies the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 processor.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses this name
to derive the name of the target \s-1ARM\s0 architecture (as if specified
by \fB\-march\fR) and the \s-1ARM\s0 processor type for which to tune for
performance (as if specified by \fB\-mtune\fR).  Where this option
is used in conjunction with \fB\-march\fR or \fB\-mtune\fR,
those options take precedence over the appropriate part of this option.
.Sp
Many of the supported CPUs implement optional architectural
extensions.  Where this is so the architectural extensions are
normally enabled by default.  If implementations that lack the
extension exist, then the extension syntax can be used to disable
those extensions that have been omitted.  For floating-point and
Advanced \s-1SIMD \s0(Neon) instructions, the settings of the options
\&\fB\-mfloat\-abi\fR and \fB\-mfpu\fR must also be considered:
floating-point and Advanced \s-1SIMD\s0 instructions will only be used if
\&\fB\-mfloat\-abi\fR is not set to \fBsoft\fR; and any setting of
\&\fB\-mfpu\fR other than \fBauto\fR will override the available
floating-point and \s-1SIMD\s0 extension instructions.
.Sp
For example, \fBcortex\-a9\fR can be found in three major
configurations: integer only, with just a floating-point unit or with
floating-point and Advanced \s-1SIMD. \s0 The default is to enable all the
instructions, but the extensions \fB+nosimd\fR and \fB+nofp\fR can
be used to disable just the \s-1SIMD\s0 or both the \s-1SIMD\s0 and floating-point
instructions respectively.

.IP "\fB\-mfpu=\fR\fIname\fR" 4

This specifies what floating-point hardware (or hardware emulation) is
available on the target.  Permissible names are: \fBauto\fR, \fBvfpv2\fR,

\&\fBfp\-armv8\fR, \fBneon\-fp\-armv8\fR and \fBcrypto\-neon\-fp\-armv8\fR.
Note that \fBneon\fR is an alias for \fBneon\-vfpv3\fR and \fBvfp\fR
is an alias for \fBvfpv2\fR.
.Sp
The setting \fBauto\fR is the default and is special.  It causes the
compiler to select the floating-point and Advanced \s-1SIMD\s0 instructions
based on the settings of \fB\-mcpu\fR and \fB\-march\fR.
.Sp
If the selected floating-point hardware includes the \s-1NEON\s0 extension
(e.g. \fB\-mfpu=neon\fR), note that floating-point
operations are not generated by \s-1GCC\s0's auto-vectorization pass unless
\&\fB\-funsafe\-math\-optimizations\fR is also specified.  This is
because \s-1NEON\s0 hardware does not fully implement the \s-1IEEE 754\s0 standard for
floating-point arithmetic (in particular denormal values are treated as
zero), so the use of \s-1NEON\s0 instructions may lead to a loss of precision.
.Sp
You can also set the fpu name at function level by using the \f(CW\*(C`target("fpu=")\*(C'\fR function attributes or pragmas.
.IP "\fB\-mfp16\-format=\fR\fIname\fR" 4

Permissible names are \fBnone\fR, \fBieee\fR, and \fBalternative\fR;
the default is \fBnone\fR, in which case the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_fp16\*(C'\fR type is not
defined.
.IP "\fB\-mstructure\-size\-boundary=\fR\fIn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mstructure-size-boundary=n"
The sizes of all structures and unions are rounded up to a multiple
of the number of bits set by this option.  Permissible values are 8, 32
and 64.  The default value varies for different toolchains.  For the \s-1COFF\s0
targeted toolchain the default value is 8.  A value of 64 is only allowed
if the underlying \s-1ABI\s0 supports it.
.Sp
Specifying a larger number can produce faster, more efficient code, but
can also increase the size of the program.  Different values are potentially
incompatible.  Code compiled with one value cannot necessarily expect to
work with code or libraries compiled with another value, if they exchange
information using structures or unions.
.Sp
This option is deprecated.
.IP "\fB\-mabort\-on\-noreturn\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabort-on-noreturn"
Generate a call to the function \f(CW\*(C`abort\*(C'\fR at the end of a

.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-long-calls"
.PD
Tells the compiler to perform function calls by first loading the
address of the function into a register and then performing a subroutine
call on this register.  This switch is needed if the target function
lies outside of the 64\-megabyte addressing range of the offset-based
version of subroutine call instruction.
.Sp
Even if this switch is enabled, not all function calls are turned
into long calls.  The heuristic is that static functions, functions
that have the \f(CW\*(C`short_call\*(C'\fR attribute, functions that are inside
the scope of a \f(CW\*(C`#pragma no_long_calls\*(C'\fR directive, and functions whose
definitions have already been compiled within the current compilation
unit are not turned into long calls.  The exceptions to this rule are
that weak function definitions, functions with the \f(CW\*(C`long_call\*(C'\fR
attribute or the \f(CW\*(C`section\*(C'\fR attribute, and functions that are within
the scope of a \f(CW\*(C`#pragma long_calls\*(C'\fR directive are always
turned into long calls.
.Sp
This feature is not enabled by default.  Specifying
\&\fB\-mno\-long\-calls\fR restores the default behavior, as does
placing the function calls within the scope of a \f(CW\*(C`#pragma
long_calls_off\*(C'\fR directive.  Note these switches have no effect on how
the compiler generates code to handle function calls via function
pointers.
.IP "\fB\-msingle\-pic\-base\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msingle-pic-base"
Treat the register used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing as read-only, rather than

.IX Item "-mpic-register=reg"
Specify the register to be used for \s-1PIC\s0 addressing.
For standard \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default is any suitable register
determined by compiler.  For single \s-1PIC\s0 base case, the default is

otherwise the default is \fBR10\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mpic\-data\-is\-text\-relative\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mpic-data-is-text-relative"
Assume that the displacement between the text and data segments is fixed

non-VxWorks \s-1RTP\s0 targets, this option is enabled by default.  When
disabled on such targets, it will enable \fB\-msingle\-pic\-base\fR by
default.
.IP "\fB\-mpoke\-function\-name\fR" 4

When performing a stack backtrace, code can inspect the value of

location \f(CW\*(C`pc \- 12\*(C'\fR and the top 8 bits are set, then we know that
there is a function name embedded immediately preceding this location

Accumulate outgoing function arguments and acquire/release the needed

before calling a function and popped afterwards.

Popping the arguments after the function call can be expensive on

compiler is the same, but the instructions in the executable may
differ from instructions in the assembler code.

For any setting other than \fB\-mmcu=avr2\fR or \fB\-mmcu=avr25\fR

\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR and Devices with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash
.IX Subsection "EIND and Devices with More Than 128 Ki Bytes of Flash"
.PP
Pointers in the implementation are 16@tie{}bits wide.
The address of a function or label is represented as word address so
that indirect jumps and calls can target any code address in the
range of 64@tie{}Ki words.
.PP
In order to facilitate indirect jump on devices with more than 128@tie{}Ki
bytes of program memory space, there is a special function register called
\&\f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR that serves as most significant part of the target address
when \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR instructions are used.
.PP
Indirect jumps and calls on these devices are handled as follows by
the compiler and are subject to some limitations:
.IP "*" 4
The compiler never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
.IP "*" 4
The compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR implicitly in \f(CW\*(C`EICALL\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`EIJMP\*(C'\fR
instructions or might read \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR directly in order to emulate an
indirect call/jump by means of a \f(CW\*(C`RET\*(C'\fR instruction.
.IP "*" 4
The compiler assumes that \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR never changes during the startup
code or during the application. In particular, \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR is not
saved/restored in function or interrupt service routine
prologue/epilogue.
.IP "*" 4
For indirect calls to functions and computed goto, the linker
generates \fIstubs\fR. Stubs are jump pads sometimes also called
\&\fItrampolines\fR. Thus, the indirect call/jump jumps to such a stub.
The stub contains a direct jump to the desired address.
.IP "*" 4
Linker relaxation must be turned on so that the linker generates
the stubs correctly in all situations. See the compiler option
\&\fB\-mrelax\fR and the linker option \fB\-\-relax\fR.
There are corner cases where the linker is supposed to generate stubs
but aborts without relaxation and without a helpful error message.
.IP "*" 4
The default linker script is arranged for code with \f(CW\*(C`EIND = 0\*(C'\fR.
If code is supposed to work for a setup with \f(CW\*(C`EIND != 0\*(C'\fR, a custom
linker script has to be used in order to place the sections whose
name start with \f(CW\*(C`.trampolines\*(C'\fR into the segment where \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
points to.
.IP "*" 4
The startup code from libgcc never sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR.
Notice that startup code is a blend of code from libgcc and AVR-LibC.
For the impact of AVR-LibC on \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR, see the
AVR-LibC\ user\ manual (\f(CW\*(C`http://nongnu.org/avr\-libc/user\-manual/\*(C'\fR).
.IP "*" 4
It is legitimate for user-specific startup code to set up \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR
early, for example by means of initialization code located in
section \f(CW\*(C`.init3\*(C'\fR. Such code runs prior to general startup code
that initializes \s-1RAM\s0 and calls constructors, but after the bit
of startup code from AVR-LibC that sets \f(CW\*(C`EIND\*(C'\fR to the segment
where the vector table is located.

.PP
Some \s-1AVR\s0 devices support memories larger than the 64@tie{}KiB range
that can be accessed with 16\-bit pointers.  To access memory locations
outside this 64@tie{}KiB range, the content of a \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR
register is used as high part of the address:
The \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Y\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`Z\*(C'\fR address register is concatenated
with the \f(CW\*(C`RAMPX\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPY\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR special function
register, respectively, to get a wide address. Similarly,
\&\f(CW\*(C`RAMPD\*(C'\fR is used together with direct addressing.
.IP "*" 4

registers with zero.
.IP "*" 4
If a \fB\s-1AVR\s0 Named Address Spaces,named address space\fR other than
generic or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_flash\*(C'\fR is used, then \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR is set
as needed before the operation.
.IP "*" 4
If the device supports \s-1RAM\s0 larger than 64@tie{}KiB and the compiler
needs to change \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR to accomplish an operation, \f(CW\*(C`RAMPZ\*(C'\fR
is reset to zero after the operation.
.IP "*" 4
If the device comes with a specific \f(CW\*(C`RAMP\*(C'\fR register, the \s-1ISR\s0
prologue/epilogue saves/restores that \s-1SFR\s0 and initializes it with
zero in case the \s-1ISR\s0 code might (implicitly) use it.
.IP "*" 4
\&\s-1RAM\s0 larger than 64@tie{}KiB is not supported by \s-1GCC\s0 for \s-1AVR\s0 targets.

.PP
\fIDarwin Options\fR
.IX Subsection "Darwin Options"
.PP
These options are defined for all architectures running the Darwin operating
system.
.PP
\&\s-1FSF GCC\s0 on Darwin does not create \*(L"fat\*(R" object files; it creates
an object file for the single architecture that \s-1GCC\s0 was built to
target.  Apple's \s-1GCC\s0 on Darwin does create \*(L"fat\*(R" files if multiple
\&\fB\-arch\fR options are used; it does so by running the compiler or
linker multiple times and joining the results together with
\&\fIlipo\fR.
.PP
The subtype of the file created (like \fBppc7400\fR or \fBppc970\fR or
\&\fBi686\fR) is determined by the flags that specify the \s-1ISA\s0
that \s-1GCC\s0 is targeting, like \fB\-mcpu\fR or \fB\-march\fR.  The
\&\fB\-force_cpusubtype_ALL\fR option can be used to override this.
.PP
The Darwin tools vary in their behavior when presented with an \s-1ISA\s0
mismatch.  The assembler, \fIas\fR, only permits instructions to
be used that are valid for the subtype of the file it is generating,
so you cannot put 64\-bit instructions in a \fBppc750\fR object file.
The linker for shared libraries, \fI/usr/bin/libtool\fR, fails
and prints an error if asked to create a shared library with a less
restrictive subtype than its input files (for instance, trying to put
a \fBppc970\fR object file in a \fBppc7400\fR library).  The linker
for executables, \fBld\fR, quietly gives the executable the most
restrictive subtype of any of its input files.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-Fdir"
Add the framework directory \fIdir\fR to the head of the list of
directories to be searched for header files.  These directories are
interleaved with those specified by \fB\-I\fR options and are
scanned in a left-to-right order.
.Sp
A framework directory is a directory with frameworks in it.  A
framework is a directory with a \fIHeaders\fR and/or
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR directory contained directly in it that ends
in \fI.framework\fR.  The name of a framework is the name of this
directory excluding the \fI.framework\fR.  Headers associated with
the framework are found in one of those two directories, with
\&\fIHeaders\fR being searched first.  A subframework is a framework
directory that is in a framework's \fIFrameworks\fR directory.
Includes of subframework headers can only appear in a header of a
framework that contains the subframework, or in a sibling subframework
header.  Two subframeworks are siblings if they occur in the same
framework.  A subframework should not have the same name as a
framework; a warning is issued if this is violated.  Currently a
subframework cannot have subframeworks; in the future, the mechanism
may be extended to support this.  The standard frameworks can be found
in \fI/System/Library/Frameworks\fR and
\&\fI/Library/Frameworks\fR.  An example include looks like
\&\f(CW\*(C`#include <Framework/header.h>\*(C'\fR, where \fIFramework\fR denotes
the name of the framework and \fIheader.h\fR is found in the
\&\fIPrivateHeaders\fR or \fIHeaders\fR directory.
.IP "\fB\-iframework\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-iframeworkdir"
Like \fB\-F\fR except the directory is a treated as a system
directory.  The main difference between this \fB\-iframework\fR and
\&\fB\-F\fR is that with \fB\-iframework\fR the compiler does not
warn about constructs contained within header files found via
\&\fIdir\fR.  This option is valid only for the C family of languages.
.IP "\fB\-gused\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gused"
Emit debugging information for symbols that are used.  For stabs
debugging format, this enables \fB\-feliminate\-unused\-debug\-symbols\fR.
This is by default \s-1ON.\s0
.IP "\fB\-gfull\fR" 4
.IX Item "-gfull"
Emit debugging information for all symbols and types.
.IP "\fB\-mmacosx\-version\-min=\fR\fIversion\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmacosx-version-min=version"
The earliest version of MacOS X that this executable will run on
is \fIversion\fR.  Typical values of \fIversion\fR include \f(CW10.1\fR,
\&\f(CW10.2\fR, and \f(CW10.3.9\fR.
.Sp
If the compiler was built to use the system's headers by default,
then the default for this option is the system version on which the
compiler is running, otherwise the default is to make choices that
are compatible with as many systems and code bases as possible.
.IP "\fB\-mkernel\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mkernel"
Enable kernel development mode.  The \fB\-mkernel\fR option sets
\&\fB\-static\fR, \fB\-fno\-common\fR, \fB\-fno\-use\-cxa\-atexit\fR,
\&\fB\-fno\-exceptions\fR, \fB\-fno\-non\-call\-exceptions\fR,
\&\fB\-fapple\-kext\fR, \fB\-fno\-weak\fR and \fB\-fno\-rtti\fR where
applicable.  This mode also sets \fB\-mno\-altivec\fR,
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR, \fB\-fno\-builtin\fR and
\&\fB\-mlong\-branch\fR for PowerPC targets.
.IP "\fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mone-byte-bool"
Override the defaults for \f(CW\*(C`bool\*(C'\fR so that \f(CW\*(C`sizeof(bool)==1\*(C'\fR.
By default \f(CW\*(C`sizeof(bool)\*(C'\fR is \f(CW4\fR when compiling for
Darwin/PowerPC and \f(CW1\fR when compiling for Darwin/x86, so this
option has no effect on x86.
.Sp
\&\fBWarning:\fR The \fB\-mone\-byte\-bool\fR switch causes \s-1GCC\s0
to generate code that is not binary compatible with code generated
without that switch.  Using this switch may require recompiling all
other modules in a program, including system libraries.  Use this
switch to conform to a non-default data model.

These \fB\-m\fR options are defined for the \s-1DEC\s0 Alpha implementations:
.IP "\fB\-mno\-soft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-soft-float"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
.PD
Use (do not use) the hardware floating-point instructions for
floating-point operations.  When \fB\-msoft\-float\fR is specified,
functions in \fIlibgcc.a\fR are used to perform floating-point
operations.  Unless they are replaced by routines that emulate the
floating-point operations, or compiled in such a way as to call such
emulations routines, these routines issue floating-point
operations.   If you are compiling for an Alpha without floating-point
operations, you must ensure that the library is built so as not to call
them.
.Sp
Note that Alpha implementations without floating-point operations are
required to have floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-reg\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-reg"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-fp-regs"
.PD
Generate code that uses (does not use) the floating-point register set.
\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR implies \fB\-msoft\-float\fR.  If the floating-point
register set is not used, floating-point operands are passed in integer
registers as if they were integers and floating-point results are passed
in \f(CW$0\fR instead of \f(CW$f0\fR.  This is a non-standard calling sequence,
so any function with a floating-point argument or return value called by code
compiled with \fB\-mno\-fp\-regs\fR must also be compiled with that
option.
.Sp
A typical use of this option is building a kernel that does not use,
and hence need not save and restore, any floating-point registers.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee"
The Alpha architecture implements floating-point hardware optimized for
maximum performance.  It is mostly compliant with the \s-1IEEE\s0 floating-point
standard.  However, for full compliance, software assistance is
required.  This option generates code fully IEEE-compliant code
\&\fIexcept\fR that the \fIinexact-flag\fR is not maintained (see below).
If this option is turned on, the preprocessor macro \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR is
defined during compilation.  The resulting code is less efficient but is
able to correctly support denormalized numbers and exceptional \s-1IEEE\s0
values such as not-a-number and plus/minus infinity.  Other Alpha
compilers call this option \fB\-ieee_with_no_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mieee\-with\-inexact\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mieee-with-inexact"
This is like \fB\-mieee\fR except the generated code also maintains
the \s-1IEEE \s0\fIinexact-flag\fR.  Turning on this option causes the
generated code to implement fully-compliant \s-1IEEE\s0 math.  In addition to
\&\f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_IEEE_FP_EXACT\*(C'\fR is defined as a preprocessor
macro.  On some Alpha implementations the resulting code may execute
significantly slower than the code generated by default.  Since there is
very little code that depends on the \fIinexact-flag\fR, you should
normally not specify this option.  Other Alpha compilers call this
option \fB\-ieee_with_inexact\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mfp\-trap\-mode=\fR\fItrap-mode\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfp-trap-mode=trap-mode"
This option controls what floating-point related traps are enabled.

The trap mode can be set to one of four values:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
This is the default (normal) setting.  The only traps that are enabled
are the ones that cannot be disabled in software (e.g., division by zero
trap).

of:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBn\fR" 4
.IX Item "n"
Normal \s-1IEEE\s0 rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards
the nearest machine number or towards the even machine number in case
of a tie.
.IP "\fBm\fR" 4
.IX Item "m"
Round towards minus infinity.
.IP "\fBc\fR" 4
.IX Item "c"
Chopped rounding mode.  Floating-point numbers are rounded towards zero.
.IP "\fBd\fR" 4
.IX Item "d"
Dynamic rounding mode.  A field in the floating-point control register
(\fIfpcr\fR, see Alpha architecture reference manual) controls the
rounding mode in effect.  The C library initializes this register for
rounding towards plus infinity.  Thus, unless your program modifies the
\&\fIfpcr\fR, \fBd\fR corresponds to round towards plus infinity.

.RE
.IP "\fB\-mtrap\-precision=\fR\fItrap-precision\fR" 4

In the Alpha architecture, floating-point traps are imprecise.  This

floating trap and program execution normally needs to be terminated.
\&\s-1GCC\s0 can generate code that can assist operating system trap handlers
in determining the exact location that caused a floating-point trap.
Depending on the requirements of an application, different levels of
precisions can be selected:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBp\fR" 4
.IX Item "p"
Program precision.  This option is the default and means a trap handler
can only identify which program caused a floating-point exception.

This option marks the generated code as \s-1IEEE\s0 conformant.  You must not
use this option unless you also specify \fB\-mtrap\-precision=i\fR and either

Normally \s-1GCC\s0 examines a 32\- or 64\-bit integer constant to
see if it can construct it from smaller constants in two or three
instructions.  If it cannot, it outputs the constant as a literal and
generates code to load it from the data segment at run time.
.Sp
Use this option to require \s-1GCC\s0 to construct \fIall\fR integer constants
using code, even if it takes more instructions (the maximum is six).
.Sp
You typically use this option to build a shared library dynamic
loader.  Itself a shared library, it must relocate itself in memory
before it can find the variables and constants in its own data segment.

Older Alpha assemblers provided no way to generate symbol relocations
except via assembler macros.  Use of these macros does not allow
optimal instruction scheduling.  \s-1GNU\s0 binutils as of version 2.12
supports a new syntax that allows the compiler to explicitly mark
which relocations should apply to which instructions.  This option

the assembler when it is built and sets the default accordingly.

When \fB\-mexplicit\-relocs\fR is in effect, static data is
accessed via \fIgp-relative\fR relocations.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR
is used, objects 8 bytes long or smaller are placed in a \fIsmall data area\fR
(the \f(CW\*(C`.sdata\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`.sbss\*(C'\fR sections) and are accessed via
16\-bit relocations off of the \f(CW$gp\fR register.  This limits the
size of the small data area to 64KB, but allows the variables to be
directly accessed via a single instruction.
.Sp
The default is \fB\-mlarge\-data\fR.  With this option the data area
is limited to just below 2GB.  Programs that require more than 2GB of
data must use \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR to allocate the data in the
heap instead of in the program's data segment.

When \fB\-msmall\-text\fR is used, the compiler assumes that the

thus reachable with a branch instruction.  When \fB\-msmall\-data\fR

same \f(CW$gp\fR value, and thus reduce the number of instructions
required for a function call from 4 to 1.

.IX Item "-mcaller-copies"
The caller copies function arguments passed by hidden reference.  This
option should be used with care as it is not compatible with the default

.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-fpregs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdisable-fpregs"
Prevent floating-point registers from being used in any manner.  This is

floating-point registers.  If you use this option and attempt to perform
floating-point operations, the compiler aborts.
.IP "\fB\-mdisable\-indexing\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mdisable-indexing"
Prevent the compiler from using indexing address modes.  This avoids some

.IP "\fB\-mno\-space\-regs\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-space-regs"
Generate code that assumes the target has no space registers.  This allows
\&\s-1GCC\s0 to generate faster indirect calls and use unscaled index address modes.
.Sp
Such code is suitable for level 0 \s-1PA\s0 systems and kernels.
.IP "\fB\-mfast\-indirect\-calls\fR" 4

.IP "\fB\-mfixed\-range=\fR\fIregister-range\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mfixed-range=register-range"
Generate code treating the given register range as fixed registers.
A fixed register is one that the register allocator cannot use.  This is

.IP "\fB\-mlinker\-opt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlinker-opt"
Enable the optimization pass in the HP-UX linker.  Note this makes symbolic

linkers in which they give bogus error messages when linking some programs.
.IP "\fB\-msoft\-float\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msoft-float"
Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1HPPA\s0
targets.  Normally the facilities of the machine's usual C compiler are
used, but this cannot be done directly in cross-compilation.  You must make
your own arrangements to provide suitable library functions for
cross-compilation.
.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with
this option.  In particular, you need to compile \fIlibgcc.a\fR, the

\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_hp9000s700_\|_\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`_WSIO\*(C'\fR, for workstation \s-1IO. \s0 These
options are available under HP-UX and HI-UX.
.IP "\fB\-mgnu\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mgnu-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1GNU \s0\fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-shared\fR to \fBld\fR when
building a shared library.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured,
explicitly or implicitly, with the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.  This option does not
affect which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters
are passed to that \fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the
\&\fB\-\-with\-ld\fR configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and
finally by the user's \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed
using \fBwhich `gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available
on the 64\-bit HP-UX \s-1GCC,\s0 i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mhp\-ld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mhp-ld"
Use options specific to \s-1HP \s0\fBld\fR.
This passes \fB\-b\fR to \fBld\fR when building
a shared library and passes \fB+Accept TypeMismatch\fR to \fBld\fR on all
links.  It is the default when \s-1GCC\s0 is configured, explicitly or
implicitly, with the \s-1HP\s0 linker.  This option does not affect
which \fBld\fR is called; it only changes what parameters are passed to that
\&\fBld\fR.
The \fBld\fR that is called is determined by the \fB\-\-with\-ld\fR
configure option, \s-1GCC\s0's program search path, and finally by the user's
\&\fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  The linker used by \s-1GCC\s0 can be printed using \fBwhich
`gcc \-print\-prog\-name=ld`\fR.  This option is only available on the 64\-bit
HP-UX \s-1GCC,\s0 i.e. configured with \fBhppa*64*\-*\-hpux*\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mlong\-calls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlong-calls"
Generate code that uses long call sequences.  This ensures that a call
is always able to reach linker generated stubs.  The default is to generate
long calls only when the distance from the call site to the beginning
of the function or translation unit, as the case may be, exceeds a
predefined limit set by the branch type being used.  The limits for
normal calls are 7,600,000 and 240,000 bytes, respectively for the
\&\s-1PA 2.0\s0 and \s-1PA 1.X\s0 architectures.  Sibcalls are always limited at
240,000 bytes.
.Sp
Distances are measured from the beginning of functions when using the
\&\fB\-ffunction\-sections\fR option, or when using the \fB\-mgas\fR
and \fB\-mno\-portable\-runtime\fR options together under HP-UX with
the \s-1SOM\s0 linker.
.Sp
It is normally not desirable to use this option as it degrades
performance.  However, it may be useful in large applications,
particularly when partial linking is used to build the application.
.Sp
The types of long calls used depends on the capabilities of the
assembler and linker, and the type of code being generated.  The
impact on systems that support long absolute calls, and long pic
symbol-difference or pc-relative calls should be relatively small.
However, an indirect call is used on 32\-bit \s-1ELF\s0 systems in pic code
and it is quite long.
.IP "\fB\-munix=\fR\fIunix-std\fR" 4
.IX Item "-munix=unix-std"
Generate compiler predefines and select a startfile for the specified
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 standard.  The choices for \fIunix-std\fR are \fB93\fR, \fB95\fR
and \fB98\fR.  \fB93\fR is supported on all HP-UX versions.  \fB95\fR
is available on HP-UX 10.10 and later.  \fB98\fR is available on HP-UX
11.11 and later.  The default values are \fB93\fR for HP-UX 10.00,
\&\fB95\fR for HP-UX 10.10 though to 11.00, and \fB98\fR for HP-UX 11.11
and later.
.Sp
\&\fB\-munix=93\fR provides the same predefines as \s-1GCC 3.3\s0 and 3.4.
\&\fB\-munix=95\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix95.o\fR.
\&\fB\-munix=98\fR provides additional predefines for \f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_UNIX\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_\|_STDC_A1_SOURCE\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`_INCLUDE_XOPEN_SOURCE_500\*(C'\fR, and the startfile \fIunix98.o\fR.
.Sp
It is \fIimportant\fR to note that this option changes the interfaces
for various library routines.  It also affects the operational behavior
of the C library.  Thus, \fIextreme\fR care is needed in using this
option.
.Sp
Library code that is intended to operate with more than one \s-1UNIX\s0
standard must test, set and restore the variable \f(CW\*(C`_\|_xpg4_extended_mask\*(C'\fR
as appropriate.  Most \s-1GNU\s0 software doesn't provide this capability.
.IP "\fB\-nolibdld\fR" 4
.IX Item "-nolibdld"
Suppress the generation of link options to search libdld.sl when the
\&\fB\-static\fR option is specified on HP-UX 10 and later.
.IP "\fB\-static\fR" 4
.IX Item "-static"
The HP-UX implementation of setlocale in libc has a dependency on
libdld.sl.  There isn't an archive version of libdld.sl.  Thus,
when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified, special link options
are needed to resolve this dependency.
.Sp
On HP-UX 10 and later, the \s-1GCC\s0 driver adds the necessary options to
link with libdld.sl when the \fB\-static\fR option is specified.
This causes the resulting binary to be dynamic.  On the 64\-bit port,
the linkers generate dynamic binaries by default in any case.  The
\&\fB\-nolibdld\fR option can be used to prevent the \s-1GCC\s0 driver from
adding these link options.

.PD
When generating position-independent code for ColdFire, generate code
that works if the \s-1GOT\s0 has more than 8192 entries.  This code is
larger and slower than code generated without this option.  On M680x0
processors, this option is not needed; \fB\-fPIC\fR suffices.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT.\s0
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0
is smaller than about 64k.  Anything larger causes the linker
to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_68K_GOT16O foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
It should then work with very large GOTs.  However, code generated with
\&\fB\-mxgot\fR is less efficient, since it takes 4 instructions to fetch
the value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers, including newer versions of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker,
can create multiple GOTs and sort \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  If you have such a linker,
you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when compiling a single
object file that accesses more than 8192 \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

These options have no effect unless \s-1GCC\s0 is generating
position-independent code.

\&\s-1GCC\s0 defines two macros based on the value of this option.  The first

where \fIfoo\fR is the capitalized value of \f(CW\*(C`_MIPS_ARCH\*(C'\fR.
For example, \fB\-march=r2000\fR sets \f(CW\*(C`_MIPS_ARCH\*(C'\fR

Note that the \s-1EABI\s0 has a 32\-bit and a 64\-bit variant.  \s-1GCC\s0 normally
generates 64\-bit code when you select a 64\-bit architecture, but you
can use \fB\-mgp32\fR to get 32\-bit code instead.
.Sp
For information about the O64 \s-1ABI,\s0 see
<\fBhttp://gcc.gnu.org/projects/mipso64\-abi.html\fR>.
.Sp
\&\s-1GCC\s0 supports a variant of the o32 \s-1ABI\s0 in which floating-point registers
are 64 rather than 32 bits wide.  You can select this combination with
\&\fB\-mabi=32\fR \fB\-mfp64\fR.  This \s-1ABI\s0 relies on the \f(CW\*(C`mthc1\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`mfhc1\*(C'\fR instructions and is therefore only supported for
\&\s-1MIPS32R2, MIPS32R3\s0 and \s-1MIPS32R5\s0 processors.
.Sp
The register assignments for arguments and return values remain the
same, but each scalar value is passed in a single 64\-bit register
rather than a pair of 32\-bit registers.  For example, scalar
floating-point values are returned in \fB\f(CB$f0\fB\fR only, not a
\&\fB\f(CB$f0\fB\fR/\fB\f(CB$f1\fB\fR pair.  The set of call-saved registers also
remains the same in that the even-numbered double-precision registers
are saved.
.Sp
Two additional variants of the o32 \s-1ABI\s0 are supported to enable
a transition from 32\-bit to 64\-bit registers.  These are \s-1FPXX
\&\s0(\fB\-mfpxx\fR) and \s-1FP64A \s0(\fB\-mfp64\fR \fB\-mno\-odd\-spreg\fR).
The \s-1FPXX\s0 extension mandates that all code must execute correctly
when run using 32\-bit or 64\-bit registers.  The code can be interlinked
with either \s-1FP32\s0 or \s-1FP64,\s0 but not both.
The \s-1FP64A\s0 extension is similar to the \s-1FP64\s0 extension but forbids the
use of odd-numbered single-precision registers.  This can be used
in conjunction with the \f(CW\*(C`FRE\*(C'\fR mode of FPUs in \s-1MIPS32R5\s0
processors and allows both \s-1FP32\s0 and \s-1FP64A\s0 code to interlink and
run in the same process without changing \s-1FPU\s0 modes.

All \fB\-mabicalls\fR code has traditionally been position-independent,

\&\s-1GCC\s0 normally uses a single instruction to load values from the \s-1GOT.\s0
While this is relatively efficient, it only works if the \s-1GOT\s0

to report an error such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        relocation truncated to fit: R_MIPS_GOT16 foobar
.Ve
.Sp
If this happens, you should recompile your code with \fB\-mxgot\fR.
This works with very large GOTs, although the code is also
less efficient, since it takes three instructions to fetch the
value of a global symbol.
.Sp
Note that some linkers can create multiple GOTs.  If you have such a
linker, you should only need to use \fB\-mxgot\fR when a single object
file accesses more than 64k's worth of \s-1GOT\s0 entries.  Very few do.

.IP "\fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=\fR\fIsetting\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mr10k-cache-barrier=setting"
Specify whether \s-1GCC\s0 should insert cache barriers to avoid the
side effects of speculation on R10K processors.
.Sp
In common with many processors, the R10K tries to predict the outcome
of a conditional branch and speculatively executes instructions from
the \*(L"taken\*(R" branch.  It later aborts these instructions if the
predicted outcome is wrong.  However, on the R10K, even aborted
instructions can have side effects.
.Sp
This problem only affects kernel stores and, depending on the system,
kernel loads.  As an example, a speculatively-executed store may load
the target memory into cache and mark the cache line as dirty, even if
the store itself is later aborted.  If a \s-1DMA\s0 operation writes to the
same area of memory before the \*(L"dirty\*(R" line is flushed, the cached
data overwrites the DMA-ed data.  See the R10K processor manual
for a full description, including other potential problems.
.Sp
One workaround is to insert cache barrier instructions before every memory
access that might be speculatively executed and that might have side
effects even if aborted.  \fB\-mr10k\-cache\-barrier=\fR\fIsetting\fR
controls \s-1GCC\s0's implementation of this workaround.  It assumes that
aborted accesses to any byte in the following regions does not have
side effects:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
.IX Item "1."
the memory occupied by the current function's stack frame;
.IP "2." 4
.IX Item "2."
the memory occupied by an incoming stack argument;
.IP "3." 4
.IX Item "3."
the memory occupied by an object with a link-time-constant address.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It is the kernel's responsibility to ensure that speculative
accesses to these regions are indeed safe.
.Sp
If the input program contains a function declaration such as:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&        void foo (void);
.Ve
.Sp
then the implementation of \f(CW\*(C`foo\*(C'\fR must allow \f(CW\*(C`j foo\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`jal foo\*(C'\fR to be executed speculatively.  \s-1GCC\s0 honors this
restriction for functions it compiles itself.  It expects non-GCC
functions (such as hand-written assembly code) to do the same.

These options are defined for the \s-1MSP430:\s0
.IP "\fB\-masm\-hex\fR" 4
.IX Item "-masm-hex"
Force assembly output to always use hex constants.  Normally such
constants are signed decimals, but this option is available for
testsuite and/or aesthetic purposes.
.IP "\fB\-mmcu=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mmcu="
Select the \s-1MCU\s0 to target.  This is used to create a C preprocessor
symbol based upon the \s-1MCU\s0 name, converted to upper case and pre\- and
post-fixed with \fB_\|_\fR.  This in turn is used by the
\&\fImsp430.h\fR header file to select an MCU-specific supplementary
header file.
.Sp
The option also sets the \s-1ISA\s0 to use.  If the \s-1MCU\s0 name is one that is
known to only support the 430 \s-1ISA\s0 then that is selected, otherwise the
430X \s-1ISA\s0 is selected.  A generic \s-1MCU\s0 name of \fBmsp430\fR can also be
used to select the 430 \s-1ISA. \s0 Similarly the generic \fBmsp430x\fR \s-1MCU\s0
name selects the 430X \s-1ISA.\s0
.Sp
In addition an MCU-specific linker script is added to the linker
command line.  The script's name is the name of the \s-1MCU\s0 with
\&\fI.ld\fR appended.  Thus specifying \fB\-mmcu=xxx\fR on the \fBgcc\fR
command line defines the C preprocessor symbol \f(CW\*(C`_\|_XXX_\|_\*(C'\fR and
cause the linker to search for a script called \fIxxx.ld\fR.
.Sp
This option is also passed on to the assembler.

\&\fB\-mhwmult\fR option.  It also toggles warnings about unrecognized
\&\s-1MCU\s0 names.  This option is on by default.
.IP "\fB\-mcpu=\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mcpu="
Specifies the \s-1ISA\s0 to use.  Accepted values are \fBmsp430\fR,
\&\fBmsp430x\fR and \fBmsp430xv2\fR.  This option is deprecated.  The

This option is passed to the assembler and linker, and allows the
linker to perform certain optimizations that cannot be done until
the final link.
.IP "\fBmhwmult=\fR" 4
.IX Item "mhwmult="
Describes the type of hardware multiply supported by the target.
Accepted values are \fBnone\fR for no hardware multiply, \fB16bit\fR
for the original 16\-bit\-only multiply supported by early MCUs.
\&\fB32bit\fR for the 16/32\-bit multiply supported by later MCUs and
\&\fBf5series\fR for the 16/32\-bit multiply supported by F5\-series MCUs.
A value of \fBauto\fR can also be given.  This tells \s-1GCC\s0 to deduce
the hardware multiply support based upon the \s-1MCU\s0 name provided by the
\&\fB\-mmcu\fR option.  If no \fB\-mmcu\fR option is specified or if
the \s-1MCU\s0 name is not recognized then no hardware multiply support is
assumed.  \f(CW\*(C`auto\*(C'\fR is the default setting.
.Sp
Hardware multiplies are normally performed by calling a library
routine.  This saves space in the generated code.  When compiling at
\&\fB\-O3\fR or higher however the hardware multiplier is invoked
inline.  This makes for bigger, but faster code.
.Sp
The hardware multiply routines disable interrupts whilst running and
restore the previous interrupt state when they finish.  This makes
them safe to use inside interrupt handlers as well as in normal code.
.IP "\fB\-minrt\fR" 4
.IX Item "-minrt"
Enable the use of a minimum runtime environment \- no static
initializers or constructors.  This is intended for memory-constrained

\&\f(CW\*(C`upper\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`either\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR.  The first three behave
like the corresponding attribute.  The fourth possible value \-
\&\f(CW\*(C`any\*(C'\fR \- is the default.  It leaves placement entirely up to the
linker script and how it assigns the standard sections
(\f(CW\*(C`.text\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`.data\*(C'\fR, etc) to the memory regions.
.IP "\fB\-msilicon\-errata=\fR" 4

.Sp
\&\fB\-mae=ANY\fR selects a completely generic \s-1AE\s0 type.  Code
generated with this option runs on any of the other \s-1AE\s0 types.  The
code is not as efficient as it would be if compiled for a specific
\&\s-1AE\s0 type, and some types of operation (e.g., multiplication) do not
work properly on all types of \s-1AE.\s0
.Sp
\&\fB\-mae=MUL\fR selects a \s-1MUL AE\s0 type.  This is the most useful \s-1AE\s0 type
for compiled code, and is the default.
.Sp
\&\fB\-mae=MAC\fR selects a DSP-style \s-1MAC AE. \s0 Code compiled with this
option may suffer from poor performance of byte (char) manipulation,
since the \s-1DSP AE\s0 does not provide hardware support for byte load/stores.
.IP "\fB\-msymbol\-as\-address\fR" 4
.IX Item "-msymbol-as-address"
Enable the compiler to directly use a symbol name as an address in a

rather than being permanently enabled.
.IP "\fB\-mno\-inefficient\-warnings\fR" 4

Disables warnings about the generation of inefficient code.  These
warnings can be generated, for example, when compiling code that
performs byte-level memory operations on the \s-1MAC AE\s0 type.  The \s-1MAC AE\s0 has
no hardware support for byte-level memory operations, so all byte
load/stores must be synthesized from word load/store operations.  This is

.IP "\fB\-mabi=\fR\fIABI-string\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mabi=ABI-string"
Specify integer and floating-point calling convention.  \fIABI-string\fR
contains two parts: the size of integer types and the registers used for
floating-point types.  For example \fB\-march=rv64ifd \-mabi=lp64d\fR means that
\&\fBlong\fR and pointers are 64\-bit (implicitly defining \fBint\fR to be
32\-bit), and that floating-point values up to 64 bits wide are passed in F
registers.  Contrast this with \fB\-march=rv64ifd \-mabi=lp64f\fR, which still
allows the compiler to generate code that uses the F and D extensions but only
allows floating-point values up to 32 bits long to be passed in registers; or
\&\fB\-march=rv64ifd \-mabi=lp64\fR, in which no floating-point arguments will be
passed in registers.
.Sp
The default for this argument is system dependent, users who want a specific
calling convention should specify one explicitly.  The valid calling
conventions are: \fBilp32\fR, \fBilp32f\fR, \fBilp32d\fR, \fBlp64\fR,
\&\fBlp64f\fR, and \fBlp64d\fR.  Some calling conventions are impossible to
implement on some ISAs: for example, \fB\-march=rv32if \-mabi=ilp32d\fR is
invalid because the \s-1ABI\s0 requires 64\-bit values be passed in F registers, but F
registers are only 32 bits wide.  There is also the \fBilp32e\fR \s-1ABI\s0 that can
only be used with the \fBrv32e\fR architecture.  This \s-1ABI\s0 is not well

\&\s-1RL78/G13 \s0(S2 core) targets.  The \f(CW\*(C`g14\*(C'\fR value selects the use of
the multiplication and division instructions supported by the \s-1RL78/G14
\&\s0(S3 core) parts.  The value \f(CW\*(C`rl78\*(C'\fR is an alias for \f(CW\*(C`g14\*(C'\fR and

Specifies the \s-1RL78\s0 core to target.  The default is the G14 core, also
known as an S3 core or just \s-1RL78. \s0 The G13 or S2 core does not have
multiply or divide instructions, instead it uses a hardware peripheral
for these operations.  The G10 or S1 core does not have register
banks, so it uses a different calling convention.
.Sp
If this option is set it also selects the type of hardware multiply
support to use, unless this is overridden by an explicit
\&\fB\-mmul=none\fR option on the command line.  Thus specifying
\&\fB\-mcpu=g13\fR enables the use of the G13 hardware multiply
peripheral and specifying \fB\-mcpu=g10\fR disables the use of
hardware multiplications altogether.
.Sp
Note, although the \s-1RL78/G14\s0 core is the default target, specifying
\&\fB\-mcpu=g14\fR or \fB\-mcpu=rl78\fR on the command line does
change the behavior of the toolchain since it also enables G14
hardware multiply support.  If these options are not specified on the
command line then software multiplication routines will be used even
though the code targets the \s-1RL78\s0 core.  This is for backwards
compatibility with older toolchains which did not have hardware
multiply and divide support.

You use these options to specify which instructions are available on the

Modify generation of the \s-1TOC \s0(Table Of Contents), which is created for

\&\fB\-mno\-fp\-in\-toc\fR prevents \s-1GCC\s0 from putting floating-point
constants in the \s-1TOC\s0 and \fB\-mno\-sum\-in\-toc\fR forces \s-1GCC\s0 to
generate code to calculate the sum of an address and a constant at

On Darwin/PPC systems, \f(CW\*(C`#pragma longcall\*(C'\fR generates \f(CW\*(C`jbsr
callee, L42\*(C'\fR, plus a \fIbranch island\fR (glue code).  The two target
addresses represent the callee and the branch island.  The
Darwin/PPC linker prefers the first address and generates a \f(CW\*(C`bl
callee\*(C'\fR if the \s-1PPC \s0\f(CW\*(C`bl\*(C'\fR instruction reaches the callee directly;
otherwise, the linker generates \f(CW\*(C`bl L42\*(C'\fR to call the branch
island.  The branch island is appended to the body of the
calling function; it computes the full 32\-bit address of the callee
and jumps to it.
.Sp
On Mach-O (Darwin) systems, this option directs the compiler emit to
the glue for every direct call, and the Darwin linker decides whether
to use or discard it.

determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this

These switches control the size of \f(CW\*(C`long double\*(C'\fR type. A size

.PD
Store (do not store) the address of the caller's frame as backchain pointer
into the callee's stack frame.
A backchain may be needed to allow debugging using tools that do not understand
\&\s-1DWARF\s0 call frame information.
When \fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR is in effect, the backchain pointer is stored
at the bottom of the stack frame; when \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is in effect,
the backchain is placed into the topmost word of the 96/160 byte register
save area.
.Sp
In general, code compiled with \fB\-mbackchain\fR is call-compatible with
code compiled with \fB\-mmo\-backchain\fR; however, use of the backchain
for debugging purposes usually requires that the whole binary is built with
\&\fB\-mbackchain\fR.  Note that the combination of \fB\-mbackchain\fR,
\&\fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR and \fB\-mhard\-float\fR is not supported.  In order
to build a linux kernel use \fB\-msoft\-float\fR.

.IP "\fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-packed-stack"
.PD
Use (do not use) the packed stack layout.  When \fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR is
specified, the compiler uses the all fields of the 96/160 byte register save
area only for their default purpose; unused fields still take up stack space.
When \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is specified, register save slots are densely
packed at the top of the register save area; unused space is reused for other
purposes, allowing for more efficient use of the available stack space.
However, when \fB\-mbackchain\fR is also in effect, the topmost word of
the save area is always used to store the backchain, and the return address
register is always saved two words below the backchain.
.Sp
As long as the stack frame backchain is not used, code generated with
\&\fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR is call-compatible with code generated with
\&\fB\-mno\-packed\-stack\fR.  Note that some non-FSF releases of \s-1GCC 2.95\s0 for
S/390 or zSeries generated code that uses the stack frame backchain at run
time, not just for debugging purposes.  Such code is not call-compatible
with code compiled with \fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR.  Also, note that the
combination of \fB\-mbackchain\fR,
\&\fB\-mpacked\-stack\fR and \fB\-mhard\-float\fR is not supported.  In order

Emit a warning if the current function exceeds the given frame size.  Because
this is a compile-time check it doesn't need to be a real problem when the program

If these options are provided the S/390 back end emits additional instructions in
the function prologue that trigger a trap if the stack size is \fIstack-guard\fR
bytes above the \fIstack-size\fR (remember that the stack on S/390 grows downward).
If the \fIstack-guard\fR option is omitted the smallest power of 2 larger than
the frame size of the compiled function is chosen.
These options are intended to be used to help debugging stack overflow problems.
The additionally emitted code causes only little overhead and hence can also be
used in production-like systems without greater performance degradation.  The given
values have to be exact powers of 2 and \fIstack-size\fR has to be greater than
\&\fIstack-guard\fR without exceeding 64k.
In order to be efficient the extra code makes the assumption that the stack starts
at an address aligned to the value given by \fIstack-size\fR.

instructions only.  This is only available on \s-1SH4A\s0 and is suitable for
multi-core systems.  Since the hardware instructions support only 32 bit atomic
variables access to 8 or 16 bit variables is emulated with 32 bit accesses.
Code compiled with this option is also compatible with other software
atomic model interrupt/exception handling systems if executed on an \s-1SH4A\s0
system.  Additional support from the interrupt/exception handling code of the
system is not required for this model.

Specify \fB\-mapp\-regs\fR to generate output using the global registers

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-flat\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-flat"
.PD
With \fB\-mflat\fR, the compiler does not generate save/restore instructions
and uses a \*(L"flat\*(R" or single register window model.  This model is compatible
with the regular register window model.  The local registers and the input
registers (0\-\-5) are still treated as \*(L"call-saved\*(R" registers and are

Generate output containing library calls for floating point.
\&\fBWarning:\fR the requisite libraries are not available for all \s-1SPARC\s0

.Sp
\&\fB\-msoft\-float\fR changes the calling convention in the output file;
therefore, it is only useful if you compile \fIall\fR of a program with

Generate output containing library calls for quad-word (long double)
floating-point instructions.  The functions called are those specified
in the \s-1SPARC ABI. \s0 This is the default.
.Sp
As of this writing, there are no \s-1SPARC\s0 implementations that have hardware
support for the quad-word floating-point instructions.  They all invoke
a trap handler for one of these instructions, and then the trap handler
emulates the effect of the instruction.  Because of the trap handler overhead,
this is much slower than calling the \s-1ABI\s0 library routines.  Thus the

With \fB\-munaligned\-doubles\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 assumes that doubles have 8\-byte
alignment only if they are contained in another type, or if they have an
absolute address.  Otherwise, it assumes they have 4\-byte alignment.
Specifying this option avoids some rare compatibility problems with code

assignment, in place of twice as many \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`st\*(C'\fR pairs.
However, the use of this changed alignment directly violates the \s-1SPARC

With \fB\-munsafe\-dma\fR you must use the \f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR keyword to protect

properly if it is not 16\-byte aligned.
.Sp
To ensure proper alignment of this values on the stack, the stack boundary
must be as aligned as that required by any value stored on the stack.
Further, every function must be generated such that it keeps the stack
aligned.  Thus calling a function compiled with a higher preferred
stack boundary from a function compiled with a lower preferred stack
boundary most likely misaligns the stack.  It is recommended that
libraries that use callbacks always use the default setting.
.Sp
This extra alignment does consume extra stack space, and generally
increases code size.  Code that is sensitive to stack space usage, such
as embedded systems and operating system kernels, may want to reduce the
preferred alignment to \fB\-mpreferred\-stack\-boundary=2\fR.

systems violate this specification by not clearing the \s-1DF\s0 flag in their
exception dispatchers.  The exception handler can be invoked with the \s-1DF\s0 flag
set, which leads to wrong direction mode when string instructions are used.
This option can be enabled by default on 32\-bit x86 targets by configuring

The Microsoft structure layout algorithm is fairly simple with the exception
of the bit-field packing.  
The padding and alignment of members of structures and whether a bit-field 
can straddle a storage-unit boundary are determine by these rules:
.RS 4
.IP "1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which they are" 4
.IX Item "1. Structure members are stored sequentially in the order in which they are"
declared: the first member has the lowest memory address and the last member
the highest.
.IP "2. Every data object has an alignment requirement.  The alignment requirement" 4
.IX Item "2. Every data object has an alignment requirement. The alignment requirement"
for all data except structures, unions, and arrays is either the size of the
object or the current packing size (specified with either the
\&\f(CW\*(C`aligned\*(C'\fR attribute or the \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR pragma),
whichever is less.  For structures, unions, and arrays,
the alignment requirement is the largest alignment requirement of its members.
Every object is allocated an offset so that:
.Sp

The size of \f(CW\*(C`t1\*(C'\fR is 8 bytes with the zero-length bit-field.  If the

For \f(CW\*(C`t2\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`bar\*(C'\fR is placed at offset 2, rather than offset 1.
Accordingly, the size of \f(CW\*(C`t2\*(C'\fR is 4.  For \f(CW\*(C`t3\*(C'\fR, the zero-length
bit-field does not affect the alignment of \f(CW\*(C`bar\*(C'\fR or, as a result, the size
of the structure.

instructions in the floating-point option.  This has no effect if the
floating-point option is not also enabled.  Disabling fused multiply/add
and multiply/subtract instructions forces the compiler to use separate
instructions for the multiply and add/subtract operations.  This may be
desirable in some cases where strict \s-1IEEE\s0 754\-compliant results are
required: the fused multiply add/subtract instructions do not round the
intermediate result, thereby producing results with \fImore\fR bits of
precision than specified by the \s-1IEEE\s0 standard.  Disabling fused multiply
add/subtract instructions also ensures that the program output is not
sensitive to the compiler's ability to combine multiply and add/subtract
operations.
.IP "\fB\-mserialize\-volatile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mserialize-volatile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-serialize\-volatile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-serialize-volatile"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 inserts \f(CW\*(C`MEMW\*(C'\fR instructions before
\&\f(CW\*(C`volatile\*(C'\fR memory references to guarantee sequential consistency.
The default is \fB\-mserialize\-volatile\fR.  Use
\&\fB\-mno\-serialize\-volatile\fR to omit the \f(CW\*(C`MEMW\*(C'\fR instructions.
.IP "\fB\-mforce\-no\-pic\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mforce-no-pic"
For targets, like GNU/Linux, where all user-mode Xtensa code must be
position-independent code (\s-1PIC\s0), this option disables \s-1PIC\s0 for compiling
kernel code.
.IP "\fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtext-section-literals"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-text\-section\-literals\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-text-section-literals"
.PD
These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
\&\fB\-mno\-text\-section\-literals\fR, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file.  This allows the literal pool to be placed
in a data \s-1RAM/ROM,\s0 and it also allows the linker to combine literal
pools from separate object files to remove redundant literals and
improve code size.  With \fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR, the literals
are interspersed in the text section in order to keep them as close as
possible to their references.  This may be necessary for large assembly
files.  Literals for each function are placed right before that function.
.IP "\fB\-mauto\-litpools\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mauto-litpools"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-auto\-litpools\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-auto-litpools"
.PD
These options control the treatment of literal pools.  The default is
\&\fB\-mno\-auto\-litpools\fR, which places literals in a separate
section in the output file unless \fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR is
used.  With \fB\-mauto\-litpools\fR the literals are interspersed in
the text section by the assembler.  Compiler does not produce explicit
\&\f(CW\*(C`.literal\*(C'\fR directives and loads literals into registers with
\&\f(CW\*(C`MOVI\*(C'\fR instructions instead of \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR to let the assembler
do relaxation and place literals as necessary.  This option allows
assembler to create several literal pools per function and assemble
very big functions, which may not be possible with
\&\fB\-mtext\-section\-literals\fR.
.IP "\fB\-mtarget\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mtarget-align"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-target\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-target-align"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to
automatically align instructions to reduce branch penalties at the
expense of some code density.  The assembler attempts to widen density
instructions to align branch targets and the instructions following call
instructions.  If there are not enough preceding safe density
instructions to align a target, no widening is performed.  The
default is \fB\-mtarget\-align\fR.  These options do not affect the
treatment of auto-aligned instructions like \f(CW\*(C`LOOP\*(C'\fR, which the
assembler always aligns, either by widening density instructions or
by inserting \s-1NOP\s0 instructions.
.IP "\fB\-mlongcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mlongcalls"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR" 4
.IX Item "-mno-longcalls"
.PD
When this option is enabled, \s-1GCC\s0 instructs the assembler to translate
direct calls to indirect calls unless it can determine that the target
of a direct call is in the range allowed by the call instruction.  This
translation typically occurs for calls to functions in other source
files.  Specifically, the assembler translates a direct \f(CW\*(C`CALL\*(C'\fR
instruction into an \f(CW\*(C`L32R\*(C'\fR followed by a \f(CW\*(C`CALLX\*(C'\fR instruction.
The default is \fB\-mno\-longcalls\fR.  This option should be used in
programs where the call target can potentially be out of range.  This
option is implemented in the assembler, not the compiler, so the
assembly code generated by \s-1GCC\s0 still shows direct call
instructions\-\-\-look at the disassembled object code to see the actual
instructions.  Note that the assembler uses an indirect call for
every cross-file call, not just those that really are out of range.

\fIzSeries Options\fR
.IX Subsection "zSeries Options"
.PP
These are listed under
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
This section describes several environment variables that affect how \s-1GCC\s0
operates.  Some of them work by specifying directories or prefixes to use
when searching for various kinds of files.  Some are used to specify other
aspects of the compilation environment.
.PP
Note that you can also specify places to search using options such as
\&\fB\-B\fR, \fB\-I\fR and \fB\-L\fR.  These
take precedence over places specified using environment variables, which
in turn take precedence over those specified by the configuration of \s-1GCC.\s0
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_CTYPE"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_MESSAGES"
.IP "\fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LC_ALL"
.PD
These environment variables control the way that \s-1GCC\s0 uses
localization information which allows \s-1GCC\s0 to work with different
national conventions.  \s-1GCC\s0 inspects the locale categories
\&\fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR if it has been configured to do
so.  These locale categories can be set to any value supported by your
installation.  A typical value is \fBen_GB.UTF\-8\fR for English in the United
Kingdom encoded in \s-1UTF\-8.\s0
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR environment variable specifies character
classification.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses it to determine the character boundaries in
a string; this is needed for some multibyte encodings that contain quote
and escape characters that are otherwise interpreted as a string
end or escape.
.Sp
The \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR environment variable specifies the language to
use in diagnostic messages.
.Sp
If the \fB\s-1LC_ALL\s0\fR environment variable is set, it overrides the value
of \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR; otherwise, \fB\s-1LC_CTYPE\s0\fR
and \fB\s-1LC_MESSAGES\s0\fR default to the value of the \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR
environment variable.  If none of these variables are set, \s-1GCC\s0
defaults to traditional C English behavior.
.IP "\fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "TMPDIR"
If \fB\s-1TMPDIR\s0\fR is set, it specifies the directory to use for temporary
files.  \s-1GCC\s0 uses temporary files to hold the output of one stage of
compilation which is to be used as input to the next stage: for example,
the output of the preprocessor, which is the input to the compiler
proper.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG"
Setting \fB\s-1GCC_COMPARE_DEBUG\s0\fR is nearly equivalent to passing
\&\fB\-fcompare\-debug\fR to the compiler driver.  See the documentation
of this option for more details.
.IP "\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "GCC_EXEC_PREFIX"
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is set, it specifies a prefix to use in the
names of the subprograms executed by the compiler.  No slash is added
when this prefix is combined with the name of a subprogram, but you can
specify a prefix that ends with a slash if you wish.
.Sp
If \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is not set, \s-1GCC\s0 attempts to figure out
an appropriate prefix to use based on the pathname it is invoked with.
.Sp
If \s-1GCC\s0 cannot find the subprogram using the specified prefix, it
tries looking in the usual places for the subprogram.
.Sp
The default value of \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR is
\&\fI\fIprefix\fI/lib/gcc/\fR where \fIprefix\fR is the prefix to
the installed compiler. In many cases \fIprefix\fR is the value
of \f(CW\*(C`prefix\*(C'\fR when you ran the \fIconfigure\fR script.
.Sp
Other prefixes specified with \fB\-B\fR take precedence over this prefix.
.Sp
This prefix is also used for finding files such as \fIcrt0.o\fR that are
used for linking.
.Sp
In addition, the prefix is used in an unusual way in finding the
directories to search for header files.  For each of the standard
directories whose name normally begins with \fB/usr/local/lib/gcc\fR
(more precisely, with the value of \fB\s-1GCC_INCLUDE_DIR\s0\fR), \s-1GCC\s0 tries
replacing that beginning with the specified prefix to produce an
alternate directory name.  Thus, with \fB\-Bfoo/\fR, \s-1GCC\s0 searches
\&\fIfoo/bar\fR just before it searches the standard directory 
\&\fI/usr/local/lib/bar\fR.
If a standard directory begins with the configured
\&\fIprefix\fR then the value of \fIprefix\fR is replaced by
\&\fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR when looking for header files.
.IP "\fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "COMPILER_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1COMPILER_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  \s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus
specified when searching for subprograms, if it cannot find the
subprograms using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LIBRARY_PATH"
The value of \fB\s-1LIBRARY_PATH\s0\fR is a colon-separated list of
directories, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR.  When configured as a native compiler,
\&\s-1GCC\s0 tries the directories thus specified when searching for special
linker files, if it cannot find them using \fB\s-1GCC_EXEC_PREFIX\s0\fR.  Linking
using \s-1GCC\s0 also uses these directories when searching for ordinary
libraries for the \fB\-l\fR option (but directories specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR come first).
.IP "\fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "LANG"
This variable is used to pass locale information to the compiler.  One way in
which this information is used is to determine the character set to be used
when character literals, string literals and comments are parsed in C and \*(C+.
When the compiler is configured to allow multibyte characters,
the following values for \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR are recognized:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBC\-JIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-JIS"
Recognize \s-1JIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-SJIS\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-SJIS"
Recognize \s-1SJIS\s0 characters.
.IP "\fBC\-EUCJP\fR" 4
.IX Item "C-EUCJP"
Recognize \s-1EUCJP\s0 characters.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
If \fB\s-1LANG\s0\fR is not defined, or if it has some other value, then the
compiler uses \f(CW\*(C`mblen\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`mbtowc\*(C'\fR as defined by the default locale to
recognize and translate multibyte characters.
.RE
.PP
Some additional environment variables affect the behavior of the
preprocessor.
.IP "\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPATH"
.PD 0
.IP "\fBC_INCLUDE_PATH\fR" 4
.IX Item "C_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
.IP "\fB\s-1OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH"
.PD
Each variable's value is a list of directories separated by a special
character, much like \fB\s-1PATH\s0\fR, in which to look for header files.
The special character, \f(CW\*(C`PATH_SEPARATOR\*(C'\fR, is target-dependent and
determined at \s-1GCC\s0 build time.  For Microsoft Windows-based targets it is a
semicolon, and for almost all other targets it is a colon.
.Sp
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR specifies a list of directories to be searched as if
specified with \fB\-I\fR, but after any paths given with \fB\-I\fR
options on the command line.  This environment variable is used
regardless of which language is being preprocessed.
.Sp
The remaining environment variables apply only when preprocessing the
particular language indicated.  Each specifies a list of directories
to be searched as if specified with \fB\-isystem\fR, but after any
paths given with \fB\-isystem\fR options on the command line.
.Sp
In all these variables, an empty element instructs the compiler to
search its current working directory.  Empty elements can appear at the
beginning or end of a path.  For instance, if the value of
\&\fB\s-1CPATH\s0\fR is \f(CW\*(C`:/special/include\*(C'\fR, that has the same
effect as \fB\-I.\ \-I/special/include\fR.
.IP "\fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT"
If this variable is set, its value specifies how to output
dependencies for Make based on the non-system header files processed
by the compiler.  System header files are ignored in the dependency
output.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR can be just a file name, in
which case the Make rules are written to that file, guessing the target
name from the source file name.  Or the value can have the form
\&\fIfile\fR\fB \fR\fItarget\fR, in which case the rules are written to
file \fIfile\fR using \fItarget\fR as the target name.
.Sp
In other words, this environment variable is equivalent to combining
the options \fB\-MM\fR and \fB\-MF\fR,
with an optional \fB\-MT\fR switch too.
.IP "\fB\s-1SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SUNPRO_DEPENDENCIES"
This variable is the same as \fB\s-1DEPENDENCIES_OUTPUT\s0\fR (see above),
except that system header files are not ignored, so it implies
\&\fB\-M\fR rather than \fB\-MM\fR.  However, the dependence on the
main input file is omitted.
.IP "\fB\s-1SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH"
If this variable is set, its value specifies a \s-1UNIX\s0 timestamp to be
used in replacement of the current date and time in the \f(CW\*(C`_\|_DATE_\|_\*(C'\fR
and \f(CW\*(C`_\|_TIME_\|_\*(C'\fR macros, so that the embedded timestamps become
reproducible.
.Sp
The value of \fB\s-1SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH\s0\fR must be a \s-1UNIX\s0 timestamp,
defined as the number of seconds (excluding leap seconds) since
01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 represented in \s-1ASCII\s0; identical to the output of
\&\fB\f(CB@command\fB{date +%s\fR} on GNU/Linux and other systems that support the
\&\f(CW%s\fR extension in the \f(CW\*(C`date\*(C'\fR command.
.Sp
The value should be a known timestamp such as the last modification
time of the source or package and it should be set by the build
process.
