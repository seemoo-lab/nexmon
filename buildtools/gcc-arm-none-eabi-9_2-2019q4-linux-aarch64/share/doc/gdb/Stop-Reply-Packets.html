<a name="index-stop-reply-packets"></a>

<p>The &lsquo;<samp>C</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>S</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>s</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>vCont</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>vAttach</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>vRun</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>vStopped</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo; packets can
receive any of the below as a reply.  Except for &lsquo;<samp>?</samp>&rsquo;
and &lsquo;<samp>vStopped</samp>&rsquo;, that reply is only returned
when the target halts.  In the below the exact meaning of <em>signal
number</em> is defined by the header <samp>include/gdb/signals.h</samp> in the
<small>GDB</small> source code.
</p>
<p>In non-stop mode, the server will simply reply &lsquo;<samp>OK</samp>&rsquo; to commands
such as &lsquo;<samp>vCont</samp>&rsquo;; any stop will be the subject of a future
notification.  See <a href="Remote-Non_002dStop.html#Remote-Non_002dStop">Remote Non-Stop</a>.
</p>
<p>As in the description of request packets, we include spaces in the
reply templates for clarity; these are not part of the reply packet&rsquo;s
syntax.  No <small>GDB</small> stop reply packet uses spaces to separate its
components.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>S <var>AA</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The program received signal number <var>AA</var> (a two-digit hexadecimal
number).  This is equivalent to a &lsquo;<samp>T</samp>&rsquo; response with no
<var>n</var>:<var>r</var> pairs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>T <var>AA</var> <var>n1</var>:<var>r1</var>;<var>n2</var>:<var>r2</var>;&hellip;</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><a name="index-T-packet-reply"></a>
<p>The program received signal number <var>AA</var> (a two-digit hexadecimal
number).  This is equivalent to an &lsquo;<samp>S</samp>&rsquo; response, except that the
&lsquo;<samp><var>n</var>:<var>r</var></samp>&rsquo; pairs can carry values of important registers
and other information directly in the stop reply packet, reducing
round-trip latency.  Single-step and breakpoint traps are reported
this way.  Each &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var>:<var>r</var></samp>&rsquo; pair is interpreted as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li> If <var>n</var> is a hexadecimal number, it is a register number, and the
corresponding <var>r</var> gives that register&rsquo;s value.  The data <var>r</var> is a
series of bytes in target byte order, with each byte given by a
two-digit hex number.

</li><li> If <var>n</var> is &lsquo;<samp>thread</samp>&rsquo;, then <var>r</var> is the <var>thread-id</var> of
the stopped thread, as specified in <a href="Packets.html#thread_002did-syntax">thread-id syntax</a>.

</li><li> If <var>n</var> is &lsquo;<samp>core</samp>&rsquo;, then <var>r</var> is the hexadecimal number of
the core on which the stop event was detected.

</li><li> If <var>n</var> is a recognized <em>stop reason</em>, it describes a more
specific event that stopped the target.  The currently defined stop
reasons are listed below.  The <var>aa</var> should be &lsquo;<samp>05</samp>&rsquo;, the trap
signal.  At most one stop reason should be present.

</li><li> Otherwise, <small>GDB</small> should ignore this &lsquo;<samp><var>n</var>:<var>r</var></samp>&rsquo; pair
and go on to the next; this allows us to extend the protocol in the
future.
</li></ul>

<p>The currently defined stop reasons are:

<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>watch</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>rwatch</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>awatch</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The packet indicates a watchpoint hit, and <var>r</var> is the data address, in
hex.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>syscall_entry</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>syscall_return</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The packet indicates a syscall entry or return, and <var>r</var> is the
syscall number, in hex.
</p>
<a name="index-shared-library-events_002c-remote-reply"></a>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>library</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The packet indicates that the loaded libraries have changed.
<small>GDB</small> should use &lsquo;<samp>qXfer:libraries:read</samp>&rsquo; to fetch a new
list of loaded libraries.  The <var>r</var> part is ignored.
</p>
<a name="index-replay-log-events_002c-remote-reply"></a>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>replaylog</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The packet indicates that the target cannot continue replaying 
logged execution events, because it has reached the end (or the
beginning when executing backward) of the log.  The value of <var>r</var>
will be either &lsquo;<samp>begin</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>end</samp>&rsquo;.  See <a href="Reverse-Execution.html#Reverse-Execution">Reverse Execution</a>, 
for more information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>swbreak</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><a name="swbreak-stop-reason"></a><p>The packet indicates a software breakpoint instruction was executed,
irrespective of whether it was <small>GDB</small> that planted the
breakpoint or the breakpoint is hardcoded in the program.  The <var>r</var>
part must be left empty.
</p>
<p>On some architectures, such as x86, at the architecture level, when a
breakpoint instruction executes the program counter points at the
breakpoint address plus an offset.  On such targets, the stub is
responsible for adjusting the PC to point back at the breakpoint
address.
</p>
<p>This packet should not be sent by default; older <small>GDB</small> versions
did not support it.  <small>GDB</small> requests it, by supplying an
appropriate &lsquo;<samp>qSupported</samp>&rsquo; feature (see <a href="General-Query-Packets.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).  The
remote stub must also supply the appropriate &lsquo;<samp>qSupported</samp>&rsquo; feature
indicating support.
</p>
<p>This packet is required for correct non-stop mode operation.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>hwbreak</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The packet indicates the target stopped for a hardware breakpoint.
The <var>r</var> part must be left empty.
</p>
<p>The same remarks about &lsquo;<samp>qSupported</samp>&rsquo; and non-stop mode above
apply.

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>vforkdone</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The packet indicates that a child process created by a vfork
has either called <code>exec</code> or terminated, so that the
address spaces of the parent and child process are no longer
shared. The <var>r</var> part is ignored.  This packet is only
applicable to targets that support vforkdone events.

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>create</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The packet indicates that the thread was just created.  The new thread
is stopped until <small>GDB</small> sets it running with a resumption packet
(see <a href="Packets.html#vCont-packet">vCont packet</a>).  This packet should not be sent by default;
<small>GDB</small> requests it with the <a href="General-Query-Packets.html#QThreadEvents">QThreadEvents</a> packet.  See
also the &lsquo;<samp>w</samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="#thread-exit-event">thread exit event</a>) remote reply below.  The

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>W <var>AA</var> ; process:<var>pid</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>The process exited, and <var>AA</var> is the exit status.  This is only
applicable to certain targets.
</p>
<p>The second form of the response, including the process ID of the
exited process, can be used only when <small>GDB</small> has reported
support for multiprocess protocol extensions; see <a href="General-Query-Packets.html#multiprocess-extensions">multiprocess extensions</a>.  Both <var>AA</var> and <var>pid</var> are formatted as big-endian

<dt>&lsquo;<samp>w <var>AA</var> ; <var>tid</var></samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd>
<p>The thread exited, and <var>AA</var> is the exit status.  This response
should not be sent by default; <small>GDB</small> requests it with the
<a href="General-Query-Packets.html#QThreadEvents">QThreadEvents</a> packet.  See also <a href="#thread-create-event">thread create event</a> above.
<var>AA</var> is formatted as a big-endian hex string.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>N</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>There are no resumed threads left in the target.  In other words, even
though the process is alive, the last resumed thread has exited.  For
example, say the target process has two threads: thread 1 and thread
2.  The client leaves thread 1 stopped, and resumes thread 2, which
subsequently exits.  At this point, even though the process is still
alive, and thus no &lsquo;<samp>W</samp>&rsquo; stop reply is sent, no thread is actually
executing either.  The &lsquo;<samp>N</samp>&rsquo; stop reply thus informs the client
that it can stop waiting for stop replies.  This packet should not be
sent by default; older <small>GDB</small> versions did not support it.
<small>GDB</small> requests it, by supplying an appropriate
&lsquo;<samp>qSupported</samp>&rsquo; feature (see <a href="General-Query-Packets.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>).  The remote stub must
also supply the appropriate &lsquo;<samp>qSupported</samp>&rsquo; feature indicating
support.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>O <var>XX</var>&hellip;</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp><var>XX</var>&hellip;</samp>&rsquo; is hex encoding of <small>ASCII</small> data, to be
written as the program&rsquo;s console output.  This can happen at any time
while the program is running and the debugger should continue to wait
for &lsquo;<samp>W</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>T</samp>&rsquo;, etc.  This reply is not permitted in non-stop mode.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>F <var>call-id</var>,<var>parameter</var>&hellip;</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd><p><var>call-id</var> is the identifier which says which host system call should
be called.  This is just the name of the function.  Translation into the
correct system call is only applicable as it&rsquo;s defined in <small>GDB</small>.
See <a href="File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension.html#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for a list of implemented
system calls.
</p>
<p>&lsquo;<samp><var>parameter</var>&hellip;</samp>&rsquo; is a list of parameters as defined for
this very system call.
</p>
<p>The target replies with this packet when it expects <small>GDB</small> to
call a host system call on behalf of the target.  <small>GDB</small> replies
with an appropriate &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo; packet and keeps up waiting for the next
reply packet from the target.  The latest &lsquo;<samp>C</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>c</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>S</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp>s</samp>&rsquo; action is expected to be continued.  See <a href="File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension.html#File_002dI_002fO-Remote-Protocol-Extension">File-I/O Remote Protocol Extension</a>, for more details.
