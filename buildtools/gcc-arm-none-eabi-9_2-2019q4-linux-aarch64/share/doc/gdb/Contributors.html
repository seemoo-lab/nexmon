<h3 class="unnumberedsec">Contributors to <small>GDB</small></h3>

<p>Richard Stallman was the original author of <small>GDB</small>, and of many
other <small>GNU</small> programs.  Many others have contributed to its
development.  This section attempts to credit major contributors.  One
of the virtues of free software is that everyone is free to contribute
to it; with regret, we cannot actually acknowledge everyone here.  The
file <samp>ChangeLog</samp> in the <small>GDB</small> distribution approximates a
blow-by-blow account.
</p>
<p>Changes much prior to version 2.0 are lost in the mists of time.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Plea:</em> Additions to this section are particularly welcome.  If you
or your friends (or enemies, to be evenhanded) have been unfairly
omitted from this list, we would like to add your names!
</p></blockquote>

<p>So that they may not regard their many labors as thankless, we
particularly thank those who shepherded <small>GDB</small> through major
releases:
Andrew Cagney (releases 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, 6.0, 5.3, 5.2, 5.1 and 5.0);
Jim Blandy (release 4.18);
Jason Molenda (release 4.17);
Stan Shebs (release 4.14);
Fred Fish (releases 4.16, 4.15, 4.13, 4.12, 4.11, 4.10, and 4.9);
Stu Grossman and John Gilmore (releases 4.8, 4.7, 4.6, 4.5, and 4.4);
John Gilmore (releases 4.3, 4.2, 4.1, 4.0, and 3.9);
Jim Kingdon (releases 3.5, 3.4, and 3.3);
and Randy Smith (releases 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0).

</p>
<p>Jim Blandy added support for preprocessor macros, while working for Red

Duffek, Richard Henderson, Mark Kettenis, Grace Sainsbury, Kei
Sakamoto, Yoshinori Sato, Michael Snyder, Andreas Schwab, Jason
Thorpe, Corinna Vinschen, Ulrich Weigand, and Elena Zannoni, helped
with the migration of old architectures to this new framework.
</p>
<p>Andrew Cagney completely re-designed and re-implemented <small>GDB</small>&rsquo;s
unwinder framework, this consisting of a fresh new design featuring
frame IDs, independent frame sniffers, and the sentinel frame.  Mark
Kettenis implemented the <small>DWARF 2</small> unwinder, Jeff Johnston the
libunwind unwinder, and Andrew Cagney the dummy, sentinel, tramp, and
trad unwinders.  The architecture-specific changes, each involving a
complete rewrite of the architecture&rsquo;s frame code, were carried out by
Jim Blandy, Joel Brobecker, Kevin Buettner, Andrew Cagney, Stephane
Carrez, Randolph Chung, Orjan Friberg, Richard Henderson, Daniel
Jacobowitz, Jeff Johnston, Mark Kettenis, Theodore A. Roth, Kei
Sakamoto, Yoshinori Sato, Michael Snyder, Corinna Vinschen, and Ulrich
Weigand.
</p>
<p>Christian Zankel, Ross Morley, Bob Wilson, and Maxim Grigoriev from
Tensilica, Inc. contributed support for Xtensa processors.  Others
who have worked on the Xtensa port of <small>GDB</small> in the past include
Steve Tjiang, John Newlin, and Scott Foehner.
</p>
<p>Michael Eager and staff of Xilinx, Inc., contributed support for the
Xilinx MicroBlaze architecture.
</p>
<p>Initial support for the FreeBSD/mips target and native configuration
was developed by SRI International and the University of Cambridge
Computer Laboratory under DARPA/AFRL contract FA8750-10-C-0237
(&quot;CTSRD&quot;), as part of the DARPA CRASH research programme.
</p>
<p>Initial support for the FreeBSD/riscv target and native configuration
was developed by SRI International and the University of Cambridge
Computer Laboratory (Department of Computer Science and Technology)
under DARPA contract HR0011-18-C-0016 (&quot;ECATS&quot;), as part of the DARPA
SSITH research programme.
</p>
<p>The original port to the OpenRISC 1000 is believed to be due to
Alessandro Forin and Per Bothner.  More recent ports have been the work
of Jeremy Bennett, Franck Jullien, Stefan Wallentowitz and
Stafford Horne.
