<h4 class="subsubsection">23.2.2.11 Writing a Frame Filter</h4>
<a name="index-writing-a-frame-filter"></a>

<p>There are three basic elements that a frame filter must implement: it
must correctly implement the documented interface (see <a href="Frame-Filter-API.html#Frame-Filter-API">Frame Filter API</a>), it must register itself with <small>GDB</small>, and finally, it must
decide if it is to work on the data provided by <small>GDB</small>.  In all
cases, whether it works on the iterator or not, each frame filter must
return an iterator.  A bare-bones frame filter follows the pattern in
the following example.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">import gdb

class FrameFilter():

    def __init__(self):
        # Frame filter attribute creation.
        #
        # 'name' is the name of the filter that GDB will display.
        #
        # 'priority' is the priority of the filter relative to other
        # filters.
        #
        # 'enabled' is a boolean that indicates whether this filter is
        # enabled and should be executed.

        self.name = &quot;Foo&quot;
        self.priority = 100
        self.enabled = True

        # Register this frame filter with the global frame_filters
        # dictionary.
        gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

    def filter(self, frame_iter):
        # Just return the iterator.
        return frame_iter
</pre></div>

<p>The frame filter in the example above implements the three
requirements for all frame filters.  It implements the API, self
registers, and makes a decision on the iterator (in this case, it just
returns the iterator untouched).
</p>
<p>The first step is attribute creation and assignment, and as shown in
the comments the filter assigns the following attributes:  <code>name</code>,
<code>priority</code> and whether the filter should be enabled with the
<code>enabled</code> attribute.
</p>
<p>The second step is registering the frame filter with the dictionary or
dictionaries that the frame filter has interest in.  As shown in the
comments, this filter just registers itself with the global dictionary
<code>gdb.frame_filters</code>.  As noted earlier, <code>gdb.frame_filters</code>
is a dictionary that is initialized in the <code>gdb</code> module when
<small>GDB</small> starts.  What dictionary a filter registers with is an
important consideration.  Generally, if a filter is specific to a set
of code, it should be registered either in the <code>objfile</code> or
<code>progspace</code> dictionaries as they are specific to the program
currently loaded in <small>GDB</small>.  The global dictionary is always
present in <small>GDB</small> and is never unloaded.  Any filters registered
with the global dictionary will exist until <small>GDB</small> exits.  To
avoid filters that may conflict, it is generally better to register
frame filters against the dictionaries that more closely align with
the usage of the filter currently in question.  See <a href="Python-Auto_002dloading.html#Python-Auto_002dloading">Python Auto-loading</a>, for further information on auto-loading Python scripts.
</p>
<p><small>GDB</small> takes a hands-off approach to frame filter registration,
therefore it is the frame filter&rsquo;s responsibility to ensure
registration has occurred, and that any exceptions are handled
appropriately.  In particular, you may wish to handle exceptions
relating to Python dictionary key uniqueness.  It is mandatory that
the dictionary key is the same as frame filter&rsquo;s <code>name</code>
attribute.  When a user manages frame filters (see <a href="Frame-Filter-Management.html#Frame-Filter-Management">Frame Filter Management</a>), the names <small>GDB</small> will display are those contained
in the <code>name</code> attribute.
</p>
<p>The final step of this example is the implementation of the
<code>filter</code> method.  As shown in the example comments, we define the
<code>filter</code> method and note that the method must take an iterator,
and also must return an iterator.  In this bare-bones example, the
frame filter is not very useful as it just returns the iterator
untouched.  However this is a valid operation for frame filters that
have the <code>enabled</code> attribute set, but decide not to operate on
any frames.
</p>
<p>In the next example, the frame filter operates on all frames and
utilizes a frame decorator to perform some work on the frames.
See <a href="Frame-Decorator-API.html#Frame-Decorator-API">Frame Decorator API</a>, for further information on the frame
decorator interface.
</p>
<p>This example works on inlined frames.  It highlights frames which are
inlined by tagging them with an &ldquo;[inlined]&rdquo; tag.  By applying a
frame decorator to all frames with the Python <code>itertools imap</code>
method, the example defers actions to the frame decorator.  Frame
decorators are only processed when <small>GDB</small> prints the backtrace.
</p>
<p>This introduces a new decision making topic: whether to perform
decision making operations at the filtering step, or at the printing
step.  In this example&rsquo;s approach, it does not perform any filtering
decisions at the filtering step beyond mapping a frame decorator to
each frame.  This allows the actual decision making to be performed
when each frame is printed.  This is an important consideration, and
well worth reflecting upon when designing a frame filter.  An issue
that frame filters should avoid is unwinding the stack if possible.
Some stacks can run very deep, into the tens of thousands in some
cases.  To search every frame to determine if it is inlined ahead of
time may be too expensive at the filtering step.  The frame filter
cannot know how many frames it has to iterate over, and it would have
to iterate through them all.  This ends up duplicating effort as
<small>GDB</small> performs this iteration when it prints the frames.
</p>
<p>In this example decision making can be deferred to the printing step.
As each frame is printed, the frame decorator can examine each frame
in turn when <small>GDB</small> iterates.  From a performance viewpoint,
this is the most appropriate decision to make as it avoids duplicating
the effort that the printing step would undertake anyway.  Also, if
there are many frame filters unwinding the stack during filtering, it
can substantially delay the printing of the backtrace which will
result in large memory usage, and a poor user experience.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">class InlineFilter():

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = &quot;InlinedFrameFilter&quot;
        self.priority = 100
        self.enabled = True
        gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

    def filter(self, frame_iter):
        frame_iter = itertools.imap(InlinedFrameDecorator,
                                    frame_iter)
        return frame_iter
</pre></div>

<p>This frame filter is somewhat similar to the earlier example, except
that the <code>filter</code> method applies a frame decorator object called
<code>InlinedFrameDecorator</code> to each element in the iterator.  The
<code>imap</code> Python method is light-weight.  It does not proactively
iterate over the iterator, but rather creates a new iterator which
wraps the existing one.
</p>
<p>Below is the frame decorator for this example.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">class InlinedFrameDecorator(FrameDecorator):

    def __init__(self, fobj):
        super(InlinedFrameDecorator, self).__init__(fobj)

    def function(self):
        frame = fobj.inferior_frame()
        name = str(frame.name())

        if frame.type() == gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
            name = name + &quot; [inlined]&quot;

        return name
</pre></div>

<p>This frame decorator only defines and overrides the <code>function</code>
method.  It lets the supplied <code>FrameDecorator</code>, which is shipped
with <small>GDB</small>, perform the other work associated with printing
this frame.
</p>
<p>The combination of these two objects create this output from a
backtrace:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
#1  0x00400566 in max [inlined] (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:21
#2  0x00400566 in main () at inline.c:31
</pre></div>

<p>So in the case of this example, a frame decorator is applied to all
frames, regardless of whether they may be inlined or not.  As
<small>GDB</small> iterates over the iterator produced by the frame filters,
<small>GDB</small> executes each frame decorator which then makes a decision
on what to print in the <code>function</code> callback.  Using a strategy
like this is a way to defer decisions on the frame content to printing
time.
</p>
<a name="Eliding-Frames"></a>
<h4 class="subheading">Eliding Frames</h4>

<p>It might be that the above example is not desirable for representing
inlined frames, and a hierarchical approach may be preferred.  If we
want to hierarchically represent frames, the <code>elided</code> frame
decorator interface might be preferable.
</p>
<p>This example approaches the issue with the <code>elided</code> method.  This
example is quite long, but very simplistic.  It is out-of-scope for
this section to write a complete example that comprehensively covers
all approaches of finding and printing inlined frames.  However, this
example illustrates the approach an author might use.
</p>
<p>This example comprises of three sections.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">class InlineFrameFilter():

    def __init__(self):
        self.name = &quot;InlinedFrameFilter&quot;
        self.priority = 100
        self.enabled = True
        gdb.frame_filters[self.name] = self

    def filter(self, frame_iter):
        return ElidingInlineIterator(frame_iter)
</pre></div>

<p>This frame filter is very similar to the other examples.  The only
difference is this frame filter is wrapping the iterator provided to
it (<code>frame_iter</code>) with a custom iterator called
<code>ElidingInlineIterator</code>.  This again defers actions to when
<small>GDB</small> prints the backtrace, as the iterator is not traversed
until printing.
</p>
<p>The iterator for this example is as follows.  It is in this section of
the example where decisions are made on the content of the backtrace.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">class ElidingInlineIterator:
    def __init__(self, ii):
        self.input_iterator = ii

    def __iter__(self):
        return self

    def next(self):
        frame = next(self.input_iterator)

        if frame.inferior_frame().type() != gdb.INLINE_FRAME:
            return frame

        try:
            eliding_frame = next(self.input_iterator)
        except StopIteration:
            return frame
        return ElidingFrameDecorator(eliding_frame, [frame])
</pre></div>

<p>This iterator implements the Python iterator protocol.  When the
<code>next</code> function is called (when <small>GDB</small> prints each frame),
the iterator checks if this frame decorator, <code>frame</code>, is wrapping
an inlined frame.  If it is not, it returns the existing frame decorator
untouched.  If it is wrapping an inlined frame, it assumes that the
inlined frame was contained within the next oldest frame,
<code>eliding_frame</code>, which it fetches.  It then creates and returns a
frame decorator, <code>ElidingFrameDecorator</code>, which contains both the
elided frame, and the eliding frame.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">class ElidingInlineDecorator(FrameDecorator):

    def __init__(self, frame, elided_frames):
        super(ElidingInlineDecorator, self).__init__(frame)
        self.frame = frame
        self.elided_frames = elided_frames

    def elided(self):
        return iter(self.elided_frames)
</pre></div>

<p>This frame decorator overrides one function and returns the inlined
frame in the <code>elided</code> method.  As before it lets
<code>FrameDecorator</code> do the rest of the work involved in printing
this frame.  This produces the following output.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#0  0x004004e0 in bar () at inline.c:11
#2  0x00400529 in main () at inline.c:25
    #1  0x00400529 in max (b=6, a=12) at inline.c:15
</pre></div>

<p>In that output, <code>max</code> which has been inlined into <code>main</code> is
printed hierarchically.  Another approach would be to combine the
<code>function</code> method, and the <code>elided</code> method to both print a
marker in the inlined frame, and also show the hierarchical
relationship.
