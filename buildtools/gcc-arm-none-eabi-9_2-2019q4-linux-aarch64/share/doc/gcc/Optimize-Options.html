<a name="Options-That-Control-Optimization"></a>
<h3 class="section">3.10 Options That Control Optimization</h3>
<a name="index-optimize-options"></a>
<a name="index-options_002c-optimization"></a>

<p>These options control various sorts of optimizations.
</p>
<p>Without any optimization option, the compiler&rsquo;s goal is to reduce the
cost of compilation and to make debugging produce the expected
results.  Statements are independent: if you stop the program with a
breakpoint between statements, you can then assign a new value to any
variable or change the program counter to any other statement in the
function and get exactly the results you expect from the source
code.
</p>
<p>Turning on optimization flags makes the compiler attempt to improve
the performance and/or code size at the expense of compilation time
and possibly the ability to debug the program.
</p>
<p>The compiler performs optimization based on the knowledge it has of the
program.  Compiling multiple files at once to a single output file mode allows
the compiler to use information gained from all of the files when compiling
each of them.
</p>
<p>Not all optimizations are controlled directly by a flag.  Only
optimizations that have a flag are listed in this section.
</p>
<p>Most optimizations are completely disabled at <samp>-O0</samp> or if an
<samp>-O</samp> level is not set on the command line, even if individual
optimization flags are specified.  Similarly, <samp>-Og</samp> suppresses
many optimization passes.
</p>
<p>Depending on the target and how GCC was configured, a slightly different
set of optimizations may be enabled at each <samp>-O</samp> level than
those listed here.  You can invoke GCC with <samp>-Q --help=optimizers</samp>
to find out the exact set of optimizations that are enabled at each level.
See <a href="Overall-Options.html#Overall-Options">Overall Options</a>, for examples.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-O</code></dt>
<dt><code>-O1</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O"></a>
<a name="index-O1"></a>
<p>Optimize.  Optimizing compilation takes somewhat more time, and a lot
more memory for a large function.
</p>
<p>With <samp>-O</samp>, the compiler tries to reduce code size and execution
time, without performing any optimizations that take a great deal of
compilation time.
</p>

<p><samp>-O</samp> turns on the following optimization flags:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">

</dd>
<dt><code>-O2</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O2"></a>
<p>Optimize even more.  GCC performs nearly all supported optimizations
that do not involve a space-speed tradeoff.
As compared to <samp>-O</samp>, this option increases both compilation time
and the performance of the generated code.
</p>
<p><samp>-O2</samp> turns on all optimization flags specified by <samp>-O</samp>.  It
also turns on the following optimization flags:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-falign-functions  -falign-jumps

</pre></div>

<p>Please note the warning under <samp>-fgcse</samp> about
invoking <samp>-O2</samp> on programs that use computed gotos.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-O3</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O3"></a>
<p>Optimize yet more.  <samp>-O3</samp> turns on all optimizations specified
by <samp>-O2</samp> and also turns on the following optimization flags:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-fgcse-after-reload 
-finline-functions 
-fipa-cp-clone
-floop-interchange 
-floop-unroll-and-jam

-ftree-partial-pre 
-ftree-slp-vectorize

-fvect-cost-model 
-fversion-loops-for-strides
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-O0</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-O0"></a>
<p>Reduce compilation time and make debugging produce the expected
results.  This is the default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Os</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Os"></a>
<p>Optimize for size.  <samp>-Os</samp> enables all <samp>-O2</samp> optimizations 
except those that often increase code size:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-falign-functions  -falign-jumps 
-falign-labels  -falign-loops 
-fprefetch-loop-arrays  -freorder-blocks-algorithm=stc
</pre></div>

<p>It also enables <samp>-finline-functions</samp>, causes the compiler to tune for
code size rather than execution speed, and performs further optimizations
designed to reduce code size.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Ofast</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Ofast"></a>
<p>Disregard strict standards compliance.  <samp>-Ofast</samp> enables all
<samp>-O3</samp> optimizations.  It also enables optimizations that are not
valid for all standard-compliant programs.
It turns on <samp>-ffast-math</samp> and the Fortran-specific
<samp>-fstack-arrays</samp>, unless <samp>-fmax-stack-var-size</samp> is
specified, and <samp>-fno-protect-parens</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Og</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Og"></a>
<p>Optimize debugging experience.  <samp>-Og</samp> should be the optimization
level of choice for the standard edit-compile-debug cycle, offering
a reasonable level of optimization while maintaining fast compilation
and a good debugging experience.  It is a better choice than <samp>-O0</samp>
for producing debuggable code because some compiler passes
that collect debug information are disabled at <samp>-O0</samp>.
</p>
<p>Like <samp>-O0</samp>, <samp>-Og</samp> completely disables a number of 
optimization passes so that individual options controlling them have
no effect.  Otherwise <samp>-Og</samp> enables all <samp>-O1</samp> 
optimization flags except for those that may interfere with debugging:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">-fbranch-count-reg  -fdelayed-branch 
-fif-conversion  -fif-conversion2  
-finline-functions-called-once 
-fmove-loop-invariants  -fssa-phiopt 
-ftree-bit-ccp  -ftree-pta  -ftree-sra
</pre></div>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>If you use multiple <samp>-O</samp> options, with or without level numbers,
the last such option is the one that is effective.
</p>
<p>Options of the form <samp>-f<var>flag</var></samp> specify machine-independent
flags.  Most flags have both positive and negative forms; the negative
form of <samp>-ffoo</samp> is <samp>-fno-foo</samp>.  In the table
below, only one of the forms is listed&mdash;the one you typically 
use.  You can figure out the other form by either removing &lsquo;<samp>no-</samp>&rsquo;
or adding it.
</p>
<p>The following options control specific optimizations.  They are either
activated by <samp>-O</samp> options or are related to ones that are.  You
can use the following flags in the rare cases when &ldquo;fine-tuning&rdquo; of
optimizations to be performed is desired.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-fno-defer-pop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002ddefer_002dpop"></a>
<a name="index-fdefer_002dpop"></a>
<p>For machines that must pop arguments after a function call, always pop 
the arguments as soon as each function returns.  
At levels <samp>-O1</samp> and higher, <samp>-fdefer-pop</samp> is the default;
this allows the compiler to let arguments accumulate on the stack for several
function calls and pop them all at once.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fforward-propagate</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fforward_002dpropagate"></a>
<p>Perform a forward propagation pass on RTL.  The pass tries to combine two
instructions and checks if the result can be simplified.  If loop unrolling
is active, two passes are performed and the second is scheduled after
loop unrolling.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default at optimization levels <samp>-O</samp>,
<samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffp-contract=<var>style</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffp_002dcontract"></a>
<p><samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp> disables floating-point expression contraction.
<samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
such as forming of fused multiply-add operations if the target has
native support for them.
<samp>-ffp-contract=on</samp> enables floating-point expression contraction
if allowed by the language standard.  This is currently not implemented
and treated equal to <samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp>.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fomit-frame-pointer</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fomit_002dframe_002dpointer"></a>
<p>Omit the frame pointer in functions that don&rsquo;t need one.  This avoids the
instructions to save, set up and restore the frame pointer; on many targets
it also makes an extra register available.
</p>
<p>On some targets this flag has no effect because the standard calling sequence
always uses a frame pointer, so it cannot be omitted.
</p>
<p>Note that <samp>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</samp> doesn&rsquo;t guarantee the frame pointer
is used in all functions.  Several targets always omit the frame pointer in
leaf functions.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-foptimize-sibling-calls</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-foptimize_002dsibling_002dcalls"></a>
<p>Optimize sibling and tail recursive calls.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-foptimize-strlen</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-foptimize_002dstrlen"></a>
<p>Optimize various standard C string functions (e.g. <code>strlen</code>,
<code>strchr</code> or <code>strcpy</code>) and
their <code>_FORTIFY_SOURCE</code> counterparts into faster alternatives.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-inline</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dinline"></a>
<a name="index-finline"></a>
<p>Do not expand any functions inline apart from those marked with
the <code>always_inline</code> attribute.  This is the default when not
optimizing.
</p>
<p>Single functions can be exempted from inlining by marking them
with the <code>noinline</code> attribute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-small-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dsmall_002dfunctions"></a>
<p>Integrate functions into their callers when their body is smaller than expected
function call code (so overall size of program gets smaller).  The compiler
heuristically decides which functions are simple enough to be worth integrating
in this way.  This inlining applies to all functions, even those not declared
inline.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-findirect-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-findirect_002dinlining"></a>
<p>Inline also indirect calls that are discovered to be known at compile
time thanks to previous inlining.  This option has any effect only
when inlining itself is turned on by the <samp>-finline-functions</samp>
or <samp>-finline-small-functions</samp> options.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions"></a>
<p>Consider all functions for inlining, even if they are not declared inline.
The compiler heuristically decides which functions are worth integrating
in this way.
</p>
<p>If all calls to a given function are integrated, and the function is
declared <code>static</code>, then the function is normally not output as
assembler code in its own right.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.  Also enabled
by <samp>-fprofile-use</samp> and <samp>-fauto-profile</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-functions-called-once</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dfunctions_002dcalled_002donce"></a>
<p>Consider all <code>static</code> functions called once for inlining into their
caller even if they are not marked <code>inline</code>.  If a call to a given
function is integrated, then the function is not output as assembler code
in its own right.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O1</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>,
but not <samp>-Og</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fearly-inlining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fearly_002dinlining"></a>
<p>Inline functions marked by <code>always_inline</code> and functions whose body seems
smaller than the function call overhead early before doing
<samp>-fprofile-generate</samp> instrumentation and real inlining pass.  Doing so
makes profiling significantly cheaper and usually inlining faster on programs
having large chains of nested wrapper functions.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-sra</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dsra"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates, removal of
unused parameters and replacement of parameters passed by reference
by parameters passed by value.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-finline-limit=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-finline_002dlimit"></a>
<p>By default, GCC limits the size of functions that can be inlined.  This flag
allows coarse control of this limit.  <var>n</var> is the size of functions that
can be inlined in number of pseudo instructions.
</p>
<p>Inlining is actually controlled by a number of parameters, which may be
specified individually by using <samp>--param <var>name</var>=<var>value</var></samp>.
The <samp>-finline-limit=<var>n</var></samp> option sets some of these parameters
as follows:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-single</code></dt>
<dd><p>is set to <var>n</var>/2.
</p></dd>
<dt><code>max-inline-insns-auto</code></dt>
<dd><p>is set to <var>n</var>/2.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>See below for a documentation of the individual
parameters controlling inlining and for the defaults of these parameters.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> there may be no value to <samp>-finline-limit</samp> that results
in default behavior.
</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> pseudo instruction represents, in this particular context, an
abstract measurement of function&rsquo;s size.  In no way does it represent a count
of assembly instructions and as such its exact meaning might change from one
release to an another.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-keep-inline-dllexport</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dkeep_002dinline_002ddllexport"></a>
<a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002ddllexport"></a>
<p>This is a more fine-grained version of <samp>-fkeep-inline-functions</samp>,
which applies only to functions that are declared using the <code>dllexport</code>
attribute or declspec.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Declaring Attributes of
Functions</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-inline-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dinline_002dfunctions"></a>
<p>In C, emit <code>static</code> functions that are declared <code>inline</code>
into the object file, even if the function has been inlined into all
of its callers.  This switch does not affect functions using the
<code>extern inline</code> extension in GNU C90.  In C++, emit any and all
inline functions into the object file.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-static-functions</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dfunctions"></a>
<p>Emit <code>static</code> functions into the object file, even if the function
is never used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fkeep-static-consts</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fkeep_002dstatic_002dconsts"></a>
<p>Emit variables declared <code>static const</code> when optimization isn&rsquo;t turned
on, even if the variables aren&rsquo;t referenced.
</p>
<p>GCC enables this option by default.  If you want to force the compiler to
check if a variable is referenced, regardless of whether or not
optimization is turned on, use the <samp>-fno-keep-static-consts</samp> option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmerge-constants</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dconstants"></a>
<p>Attempt to merge identical constants (string constants and floating-point
constants) across compilation units.
</p>
<p>This option is the default for optimized compilation if the assembler and
linker support it.  Use <samp>-fno-merge-constants</samp> to inhibit this
behavior.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O</samp>, <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmerge-all-constants</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmerge_002dall_002dconstants"></a>
<p>Attempt to merge identical constants and identical variables.
</p>
<p>This option implies <samp>-fmerge-constants</samp>.  In addition to
<samp>-fmerge-constants</samp> this considers e.g. even constant initialized
arrays or initialized constant variables with integral or floating-point
types.  Languages like C or C++ require each variable, including multiple
instances of the same variable in recursive calls, to have distinct locations,
so using this option results in non-conforming
behavior.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmodulo-sched</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched"></a>
<p>Perform swing modulo scheduling immediately before the first scheduling
pass.  This pass looks at innermost loops and reorders their
instructions by overlapping different iterations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmodulo-sched-allow-regmoves</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmodulo_002dsched_002dallow_002dregmoves"></a>
<p>Perform more aggressive SMS-based modulo scheduling with register moves
allowed.  By setting this flag certain anti-dependences edges are
deleted, which triggers the generation of reg-moves based on the
life-range analysis.  This option is effective only with
<samp>-fmodulo-sched</samp> enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-branch-count-reg</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dbranch_002dcount_002dreg"></a>
<a name="index-fbranch_002dcount_002dreg"></a>
<p>Disable the optimization pass that scans for opportunities to use 
&ldquo;decrement and branch&rdquo; instructions on a count register instead of
instruction sequences that decrement a register, compare it against zero, and
then branch based upon the result.  This option is only meaningful on
architectures that support such instructions, which include x86, PowerPC,
IA-64 and S/390.  Note that the <samp>-fno-branch-count-reg</samp> option
doesn&rsquo;t remove the decrement and branch instructions from the generated
instruction stream introduced by other optimization passes.
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-fbranch-count-reg</samp> at <samp>-O1</samp> and higher,
except for <samp>-Og</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fno-function-cse</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fno_002dfunction_002dcse"></a>
<a name="index-ffunction_002dcse"></a>
<p>Do not put function addresses in registers; make each instruction that
calls a constant function contain the function&rsquo;s address explicitly.
</p>
<p>This option results in less efficient code, but some strange hacks
that alter the assembler output may be confused by the optimizations

<p>If the target supports a BSS section, GCC by default puts variables that

<p>In common subexpression elimination (CSE), scan through jump instructions

<p>This option tells the loop optimizer to use language constraints to
derive bounds for the number of iterations of a loop.  This assumes that
loop code does not invoke undefined behavior by for example causing signed

<p>The C++ ABI requires multiple entry points for constructors and
destructors: one for a base subobject, one for a complete object, and
one for a virtual destructor that calls operator delete afterwards.
For a hierarchy with virtual bases, the base and complete variants are
clones, which means two copies of the function.  With this option, the
base and complete variants are changed to be thunks that call a common

<dt><code>-fdelete-null-pointer-checks</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fdelete_002dnull_002dpointer_002dchecks"></a>
<p>Assume that programs cannot safely dereference null pointers, and that
no code or data element resides at address zero.
This option enables simple constant
folding optimizations at all optimization levels.  In addition, other
optimization passes in GCC use this flag to control global dataflow
analyses that eliminate useless checks for null pointers; these assume
that a memory access to address zero always results in a trap, so
that if a pointer is checked after it has already been dereferenced,
it cannot be null.
</p>
<p>Note however that in some environments this assumption is not true.
Use <samp>-fno-delete-null-pointer-checks</samp> to disable this optimization
for programs that depend on that behavior.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default on most targets.  On Nios II ELF, it
defaults to off.  On AVR, CR16, and MSP430, this option is completely disabled.

Based on the analysis of the type inheritance graph, determine for a given call
the set of likely targets. If the set is small, preferably of size 1, change
the call into a conditional deciding between direct and indirect calls.  The
speculative calls enable more optimizations, such as inlining.  When they seem

<dd><a name="index-fno_002dlifetime_002ddse"></a>
<a name="index-flifetime_002ddse"></a>
<p>In C++ the value of an object is only affected by changes within its
lifetime: when the constructor begins, the object has an indeterminate
value, and any changes during the lifetime of the object are dead when
the object is destroyed.  Normally dead store elimination will take
advantage of this; if your code relies on the value of the object
storage persisting beyond the lifetime of the object, you can use this
flag to disable this optimization.  To preserve stores before the
constructor starts (e.g. because your operator new clears the object
storage) but still treat the object as dead after the destructor you,
can use <samp>-flifetime-dse=1</samp>.  The default behavior can be
explicitly selected with <samp>-flifetime-dse=2</samp>.

<dt><code>-fsel-sched-pipelining</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsel_002dsched_002dpipelining"></a>
<p>Enable software pipelining of innermost loops during selective scheduling.
This option has no effect unless one of <samp>-fselective-scheduling</samp> or
<samp>-fselective-scheduling2</samp> is turned on.
</p>

This option has no effect unless <samp>-fsel-sched-pipelining</samp> is turned on.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsemantic-interposition</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsemantic_002dinterposition"></a>
<p>Some object formats, like ELF, allow interposing of symbols by the 
dynamic linker.
This means that for symbols exported from the DSO, the compiler cannot perform
interprocedural propagation, inlining and other optimizations in anticipation
that the function or variable in question may change. While this feature is
useful, for example, to rewrite memory allocation functions by a debugging
implementation, it is expensive in the terms of code quality.
With <samp>-fno-semantic-interposition</samp> the compiler assumes that 
if interposition happens for functions the overwriting function will have 
precisely the same semantics (and side effects). 
Similarly if interposition happens
for variables, the constructor of the variable will be the same. The flag
has no effect for functions explicitly declared inline 
(where it is never allowed for interposition to change semantics) 
and for symbols explicitly declared weak.

</dd>
<dt><code>-fshrink-wrap</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fshrink_002dwrap"></a>
<p>Emit function prologues only before parts of the function that need it,

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fshrink-wrap-separate</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fshrink_002dwrap_002dseparate"></a>
<p>Shrink-wrap separate parts of the prologue and epilogue separately, so that
those parts are only executed when needed.
This option is on by default, but has no effect unless <samp>-fshrink-wrap</samp>
is also turned on and the target supports this.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcaller-saves</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcaller_002dsaves"></a>
<p>Enable allocation of values to registers that are clobbered by
function calls, by emitting extra instructions to save and restore the
registers around such calls.  Such allocation is done only when it
seems to result in better code.
</p>
<p>This option is always enabled by default on certain machines, usually
those which have no call-preserved registers to use instead.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcombine-stack-adjustments</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcombine_002dstack_002dadjustments"></a>
<p>Tracks stack adjustments (pushes and pops) and stack memory references
and then tries to find ways to combine them.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default at <samp>-O1</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-ra</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dra"></a>
<p>Use caller save registers for allocation if those registers are not used by
any called function.  In that case it is not necessary to save and restore
them around calls.  This is only possible if called functions are part of
same compilation unit as current function and they are compiled before it.
</p>
<p>Enabled at levels <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-O3</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp>, however the option
is disabled if generated code will be instrumented for profiling
(<samp>-p</samp>, or <samp>-pg</samp>) or if callee&rsquo;s register usage cannot be known
exactly (this happens on targets that do not expose prologues
and epilogues in RTL).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fconserve-stack</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fconserve_002dstack"></a>
<p>Attempt to minimize stack usage.  The compiler attempts to use less
stack space, even if that makes the program slower.  This option
implies setting the <samp>large-stack-frame</samp> parameter to 100
and the <samp>large-stack-frame-growth</samp> parameter to 400.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-reassoc</code></dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fcode-hoisting</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fcode_002dhoisting"></a>
<p>Perform code hoisting.  Code hoisting tries to move the
evaluation of expressions executed on all paths to the function exit
as early as possible.  This is especially useful as a code size
optimization, but it often helps for code speed as well.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-pre</code></dt>

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-fre</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dfre"></a>
<p>Perform full redundancy elimination (FRE) on trees.  The difference
between FRE and PRE is that FRE only considers expressions
that are computed on all paths leading to the redundant computation.
This analysis is faster than PRE, though it exposes fewer redundancies.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-phiprop</code></dt>

<dd><a name="index-fhoist_002dadjacent_002dloads"></a>
<p>Speculatively hoist loads from both branches of an if-then-else if the
loads are from adjacent locations in the same structure and the target
architecture has a conditional move instruction.  This flag is enabled
by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-copy-prop</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcopy_002dprop"></a>

</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-stack-alignment</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dstack_002dalignment"></a>
<p>Reduce stack alignment on call sites if possible.
Enabled by default.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-pta</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dpta"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural pointer analysis and interprocedural modification
and reference analysis.  This option can cause excessive memory and
compile-time usage on large compilation units.  It is not enabled by
default at any optimization level.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-profile</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dprofile"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural profile propagation.  The functions called only from
cold functions are marked as cold. Also functions executed once (such as
<code>cold</code>, <code>noreturn</code>, static constructors or destructors) are identified. Cold
functions and loop less parts of functions executed once are then optimized for
size.
Enabled by default at <samp>-O</samp> and higher.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-cp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp"></a>
<p>Perform interprocedural constant propagation.
This optimization analyzes the program to determine when values passed
to functions are constants and then optimizes accordingly.
This optimization can substantially increase performance
if the application has constants passed to functions.
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp>, <samp>-Os</samp> and <samp>-O3</samp>.
It is also enabled by <samp>-fprofile-use</samp> and <samp>-fauto-profile</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-cp-clone</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dcp_002dclone"></a>
<p>Perform function cloning to make interprocedural constant propagation stronger.
When enabled, interprocedural constant propagation performs function cloning
when externally visible function can be called with constant arguments.
Because this optimization can create multiple copies of functions,
it may significantly increase code size
(see <samp>--param ipcp-unit-growth=<var>value</var></samp>).
This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O3</samp>.
It is also enabled by <samp>-fprofile-use</samp> and <samp>-fauto-profile</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-bit-cp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dbit_002dcp"></a>
<p>When enabled, perform interprocedural bitwise constant
propagation. This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and
by <samp>-fprofile-use</samp> and <samp>-fauto-profile</samp>.
It requires that <samp>-fipa-cp</samp> is enabled.  
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-vrp</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dvrp"></a>
<p>When enabled, perform interprocedural propagation of value
ranges. This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp>. It requires
that <samp>-fipa-cp</samp> is enabled.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fipa-icf</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fipa_002dicf"></a>
<p>Perform Identical Code Folding for functions and read-only variables.
The optimization reduces code size and may disturb unwind stacks by replacing
a function by equivalent one with a different name. The optimization works
more effectively with link-time optimization enabled.
</p>
<p>Although the behavior is similar to the Gold Linker&rsquo;s ICF optimization, GCC ICF
works on different levels and thus the optimizations are not same - there are
equivalences that are found only by GCC and equivalences found only by Gold.
</p>
<p>This flag is enabled by default at <samp>-O2</samp> and <samp>-Os</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flive-patching=<var>level</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flive_002dpatching"></a>
<p>Control GCC&rsquo;s optimizations to produce output suitable for live-patching.
</p>
<p>If the compiler&rsquo;s optimization uses a function&rsquo;s body or information extracted
from its body to optimize/change another function, the latter is called an
impacted function of the former.  If a function is patched, its impacted
functions should be patched too.
</p>
<p>The impacted functions are determined by the compiler&rsquo;s interprocedural
optimizations.  For example, a caller is impacted when inlining a function
into its caller,
cloning a function and changing its caller to call this new clone,
or extracting a function&rsquo;s pureness/constness information to optimize
its direct or indirect callers, etc.
</p>
<p>Usually, the more IPA optimizations enabled, the larger the number of
impacted functions for each function.  In order to control the number of
impacted functions and more easily compute the list of impacted function,
IPA optimizations can be partially enabled at two different levels.
</p>
<p>The <var>level</var> argument should be one of the following:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>inline-clone</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only enable inlining and cloning optimizations, which includes inlining,
cloning, interprocedural scalar replacement of aggregates and partial inlining.
As a result, when patching a function, all its callers and its clones&rsquo;
callers are impacted, therefore need to be patched as well.
</p>
<p><samp>-flive-patching=inline-clone</samp> disables the following optimization flags:

</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp>inline-only-static</samp>&rsquo;</dt>
<dd>
<p>Only enable inlining of static functions.
As a result, when patching a static function, all its callers are impacted
and so need to be patched as well.
</p>
<p>In addition to all the flags that <samp>-flive-patching=inline-clone</samp>
disables,
<samp>-flive-patching=inline-only-static</samp> disables the following additional
optimization flags:

</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-dse</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002ddse"></a>
<p>Perform dead store elimination (DSE) on trees.  A dead store is a store into

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-ch</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dch"></a>
<p>Perform loop header copying on trees.  This is beneficial since it increases
effectiveness of code motion optimizations.  It also saves one jump.  This flag

<p>Enable the identity transformation for graphite.  For every SCoP we generate
the polyhedral representation and transform it back to gimple.  Using
<samp>-fgraphite-identity</samp> we can check the costs or benefits of the

<dt><code>-ftree-coalesce-vars</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dcoalesce_002dvars"></a>
<p>While transforming the program out of the SSA representation, attempt to
reduce copying by coalescing versions of different user-defined
variables, instead of just compiler temporaries.  This may severely
limit the ability to debug an optimized program compiled with
<samp>-fno-var-tracking-assignments</samp>.  In the negated form, this flag
prevents SSA coalescing of user variables.  This option is enabled by
default if optimization is enabled, and it does very little otherwise.

<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002dif_002dconvert"></a>
<p>Attempt to transform conditional jumps in the innermost loops to

</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ftree-loop-distribution</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ftree_002dloop_002ddistribution"></a>
<p>Perform loop distribution.  This flag can improve cache performance on

by <samp>-fprofile-use</samp> and <samp>-fauto-profile</samp>.
</p>
<p>This pass distributes the initialization loops and generates a call to

<dd><a name="index-floop_002dinterchange"></a>
<p>Perform loop interchange outside of graphite.  This flag can improve cache

With the &lsquo;<samp>unlimited</samp>&rsquo; model the vectorized code-path is assumed
to be profitable while with the &lsquo;<samp>dynamic</samp>&rsquo; model a runtime check
guards the vectorized code-path to enable it only for iteration

scalar loop.  The &lsquo;<samp>cheap</samp>&rsquo; model disables vectorization of
loops where doing so would be cost prohibitive for example due to
required runtime checks for data dependence or alignment but otherwise
is equal to the &lsquo;<samp>dynamic</samp>&rsquo; model.
The default cost model depends on other optimization flags and is

<p>A combination of <samp>-fweb</samp> and CSE is often sufficient to obtain the

<p>Do not substitute constants for known return value of formatted output
functions such as <code>sprintf</code>, <code>snprintf</code>, <code>vsprintf</code>, and
<code>vsnprintf</code> (but not <code>printf</code> of <code>fprintf</code>).  This
transformation allows GCC to optimize or even eliminate branches based
on the known return value of these functions called with arguments that
are either constant, or whose values are known to be in a range that
makes determining the exact return value possible.  For example, when
<samp>-fprintf-return-value</samp> is in effect, both the branch and the
body of the <code>if</code> statement (but not the call to <code>snprint</code>)
can be optimized away when <code>i</code> is a 32-bit or smaller integer

<p>Do not guess branch probabilities using heuristics.
</p>
<p>GCC uses heuristics to guess branch probabilities if they are
not provided by profiling feedback (<samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>).  These
heuristics are based on the control flow graph.  If some branch probabilities
are specified by <code>__builtin_expect</code>, then the heuristics are
used to guess branch probabilities for the rest of the control flow graph,
taking the <code>__builtin_expect</code> info into account.  The interactions
between the heuristics and <code>__builtin_expect</code> can be complex, and in
some cases, it may be useful to disable the heuristics so that the effects
of <code>__builtin_expect</code> are easier to understand.

<p>It is also possible to specify expected probability of the expression

<p>This optimization is automatically turned off in the presence of
exception handling or unwind tables (on targets using setjump/longjump or target specific scheme), for linkonce sections, for functions with a user-defined
section attribute and on any architecture that does not support named
sections.  When <samp>-fsplit-stack</samp> is used this option is not

<dt><code>-fstrict-aliasing</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fstrict_002daliasing"></a>
<p>Allow the compiler to assume the strictest aliasing rules applicable to
the language being compiled.  For C (and C++), this activates
optimizations based on the type of expressions.  In particular, an
object of one type is assumed never to reside at the same address as an
object of a different type, unless the types are almost the same.  For
example, an <code>unsigned int</code> can alias an <code>int</code>, but not a
<code>void*</code> or a <code>double</code>.  A character type may alias any other
type.

  double d;
};

int f() {
  union a_union t;
  t.d = 3.0;
  return t.i;
}
</pre></div>
<p>The practice of reading from a different union member than the one most
recently written to (called &ldquo;type-punning&rdquo;) is common.  Even with
<samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp>, type-punning is allowed, provided the memory
is accessed through the union type.  So, the code above works as
expected.  See <a href="Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation.html#Structures-unions-enumerations-and-bit_002dfields-implementation">Structures unions enumerations and bit-fields implementation</a>.  However, this code might not:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int f() {
  union a_union t;
  int* ip;
  t.d = 3.0;
  ip = &amp;t.i;
  return *ip;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Similarly, access by taking the address, casting the resulting pointer
and dereferencing the result has undefined behavior, even if the cast
uses a union type, e.g.:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int f() {
  double d = 3.0;
  return ((union a_union *) &amp;d)-&gt;i;

<p>Do not reorder top-level functions, variables, and <code>asm</code>
statements.  Output them in the same order that they appear in the
input file.  When this option is used, unreferenced static variables
are not removed.  This option is intended to support existing code
that relies on a particular ordering.  For new code, it is better to
use attributes when possible.
</p>
<p><samp>-ftoplevel-reorder</samp> is the default at <samp>-O1</samp> and higher, and
also at <samp>-O0</samp> if <samp>-fsection-anchors</samp> is explicitly requested.

<dt><code>-fweb</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fweb"></a>
<p>Constructs webs as commonly used for register allocation purposes and assign
each web individual pseudo register.  This allows the register allocation pass
to operate on pseudos directly, but also strengthens several other optimization
passes, such as CSE, loop optimizer and trivial dead code remover.  It can,
however, make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in a
&ldquo;home register&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Enabled by default with <samp>-funroll-loops</samp>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fwhole-program</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fwhole_002dprogram"></a>
<p>Assume that the current compilation unit represents the whole program being
compiled.  All public functions and variables with the exception of <code>main</code>
and those merged by attribute <code>externally_visible</code> become static functions
and in effect are optimized more aggressively by interprocedural optimizers.
</p>
<p>This option should not be used in combination with <samp>-flto</samp>.
Instead relying on a linker plugin should provide safer and more precise
information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto[=<var>n</var>]</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto"></a>
<p>This option runs the standard link-time optimizer.  When invoked
with source code, it generates GIMPLE (one of GCC&rsquo;s internal
representations) and writes it to special ELF sections in the object
file.  When the object files are linked together, all the function
bodies are read from these ELF sections and instantiated as if they
had been part of the same translation unit.
</p>
<p>To use the link-time optimizer, <samp>-flto</samp> and optimization
options should be specified at compile time and during the final link.
It is recommended that you compile all the files participating in the
same link with the same options and also specify those options at
link time.  
For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -O2 -flto foo.c
gcc -c -O2 -flto bar.c
gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.o bar.o
</pre></div>

<p>The first two invocations to GCC save a bytecode representation
of GIMPLE into special ELF sections inside <samp>foo.o</samp> and
<samp>bar.o</samp>.  The final invocation reads the GIMPLE bytecode from
<samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>bar.o</samp>, merges the two files into a single
internal image, and compiles the result as usual.  Since both
<samp>foo.o</samp> and <samp>bar.o</samp> are merged into a single image, this
causes all the interprocedural analyses and optimizations in GCC to
work across the two files as if they were a single one.  This means,
for example, that the inliner is able to inline functions in
<samp>bar.o</samp> into functions in <samp>foo.o</samp> and vice-versa.
</p>
<p>Another (simpler) way to enable link-time optimization is:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -o myprog -flto -O2 foo.c bar.c
</pre></div>

<p>The above generates bytecode for <samp>foo.c</samp> and <samp>bar.c</samp>,
merges them together into a single GIMPLE representation and optimizes
them as usual to produce <samp>myprog</samp>.
</p>
<p>The important thing to keep in mind is that to enable link-time
optimizations you need to use the GCC driver to perform the link step.
GCC automatically performs link-time optimization if any of the
objects involved were compiled with the <samp>-flto</samp> command-line option.  
You can always override
the automatic decision to do link-time optimization
by passing <samp>-fno-lto</samp> to the link command.
</p>
<p>To make whole program optimization effective, it is necessary to make
certain whole program assumptions.  The compiler needs to know
what functions and variables can be accessed by libraries and runtime
outside of the link-time optimized unit.  When supported by the linker,
the linker plugin (see <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>) passes information
to the compiler about used and externally visible symbols.  When
the linker plugin is not available, <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> should be
used to allow the compiler to make these assumptions, which leads
to more aggressive optimization decisions.
</p>
<p>When a file is compiled with <samp>-flto</samp> without
<samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>, the generated object file is larger than
a regular object file because it contains GIMPLE bytecodes and the usual
final code (see <samp>-ffat-lto-objects</samp>.  This means that
object files with LTO information can be linked as normal object
files; if <samp>-fno-lto</samp> is passed to the linker, no
interprocedural optimizations are applied.  Note that when
<samp>-fno-fat-lto-objects</samp> is enabled the compile stage is faster
but you cannot perform a regular, non-LTO link on them.
</p>
<p>When producing the final binary, GCC only
applies link-time optimizations to those files that contain bytecode.
Therefore, you can mix and match object files and libraries with
GIMPLE bytecodes and final object code.  GCC automatically selects
which files to optimize in LTO mode and which files to link without
further processing.
</p>
<p>Generally, options specified at link time override those
specified at compile time, although in some cases GCC attempts to infer
link-time options from the settings used to compile the input files.
</p>
<p>If you do not specify an optimization level option <samp>-O</samp> at
link time, then GCC uses the highest optimization level 
used when compiling the object files.  Note that it is generally 
ineffective to specify an optimization level option only at link time and 
not at compile time, for two reasons.  First, compiling without 
optimization suppresses compiler passes that gather information 
needed for effective optimization at link time.  Second, some early
optimization passes can be performed only at compile time and 
not at link time.
</p>
<p>There are some code generation flags preserved by GCC when
generating bytecodes, as they need to be used during the final link.
Currently, the following options and their settings are taken from
the first object file that explicitly specifies them: 
<samp>-fPIC</samp>, <samp>-fpic</samp>, <samp>-fpie</samp>, <samp>-fcommon</samp>,
<samp>-fexceptions</samp>, <samp>-fnon-call-exceptions</samp>, <samp>-fgnu-tm</samp>
and all the <samp>-m</samp> target flags.
</p>
<p>Certain ABI-changing flags are required to match in all compilation units,
and trying to override this at link time with a conflicting value
is ignored.  This includes options such as <samp>-freg-struct-return</samp>
and <samp>-fpcc-struct-return</samp>. 
</p>
<p>Other options such as <samp>-ffp-contract</samp>, <samp>-fno-strict-overflow</samp>,
<samp>-fwrapv</samp>, <samp>-fno-trapv</samp> or <samp>-fno-strict-aliasing</samp>
are passed through to the link stage and merged conservatively for
conflicting translation units.  Specifically
<samp>-fno-strict-overflow</samp>, <samp>-fwrapv</samp> and <samp>-fno-trapv</samp> take
precedence; and for example <samp>-ffp-contract=off</samp> takes precedence
over <samp>-ffp-contract=fast</samp>.  You can override them at link time.
</p>
<p>If LTO encounters objects with C linkage declared with incompatible
types in separate translation units to be linked together (undefined
behavior according to ISO C99 6.2.7), a non-fatal diagnostic may be
issued.  The behavior is still undefined at run time.  Similar
diagnostics may be raised for other languages.
</p>
<p>Another feature of LTO is that it is possible to apply interprocedural
optimizations on files written in different languages:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -c -flto foo.c
g++ -c -flto bar.cc
gfortran -c -flto baz.f90
g++ -o myprog -flto -O3 foo.o bar.o baz.o -lgfortran
</pre></div>

<p>Notice that the final link is done with <code>g++</code> to get the C++
runtime libraries and <samp>-lgfortran</samp> is added to get the Fortran
runtime libraries.  In general, when mixing languages in LTO mode, you
should use the same link command options as when mixing languages in a
regular (non-LTO) compilation.
</p>
<p>If object files containing GIMPLE bytecode are stored in a library archive, say
<samp>libfoo.a</samp>, it is possible to extract and use them in an LTO link if you
are using a linker with plugin support.  To create static libraries suitable
for LTO, use <code>gcc-ar</code> and <code>gcc-ranlib</code> instead of <code>ar</code>
and <code>ranlib</code>; 
to show the symbols of object files with GIMPLE bytecode, use
<code>gcc-nm</code>.  Those commands require that <code>ar</code>, <code>ranlib</code>
and <code>nm</code> have been compiled with plugin support.  At link time, use the
flag <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp> to ensure that the library participates in
the LTO optimization process:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">gcc -o myprog -O2 -flto -fuse-linker-plugin a.o b.o -lfoo
</pre></div>

<p>With the linker plugin enabled, the linker extracts the needed
GIMPLE files from <samp>libfoo.a</samp> and passes them on to the running GCC
to make them part of the aggregated GIMPLE image to be optimized.
</p>
<p>If you are not using a linker with plugin support and/or do not
enable the linker plugin, then the objects inside <samp>libfoo.a</samp>
are extracted and linked as usual, but they do not participate
in the LTO optimization process.  In order to make a static library suitable
for both LTO optimization and usual linkage, compile its object files with
<samp>-flto</samp> <samp>-ffat-lto-objects</samp>.
</p>
<p>Link-time optimizations do not require the presence of the whole program to
operate.  If the program does not require any symbols to be exported, it is
possible to combine <samp>-flto</samp> and <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> to allow
the interprocedural optimizers to use more aggressive assumptions which may
lead to improved optimization opportunities.
Use of <samp>-fwhole-program</samp> is not needed when linker plugin is
active (see <samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>).
</p>
<p>The current implementation of LTO makes no
attempt to generate bytecode that is portable between different
types of hosts.  The bytecode files are versioned and there is a
strict version check, so bytecode files generated in one version of
GCC do not work with an older or newer version of GCC.
</p>
<p>Link-time optimization does not work well with generation of debugging
information on systems other than those using a combination of ELF and
DWARF.
</p>
<p>If you specify the optional <var>n</var>, the optimization and code
generation done at link time is executed in parallel using <var>n</var>
parallel jobs by utilizing an installed <code>make</code> program.  The
environment variable <code>MAKE</code> may be used to override the program
used.  The default value for <var>n</var> is 1.
</p>
<p>You can also specify <samp>-flto=jobserver</samp> to use GNU make&rsquo;s
job server mode to determine the number of parallel jobs. This
is useful when the Makefile calling GCC is already executing in parallel.
You must prepend a &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo; to the command recipe in the parent Makefile
for this to work.  This option likely only works if <code>MAKE</code> is
GNU make.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto-partition=<var>alg</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto_002dpartition"></a>
<p>Specify the partitioning algorithm used by the link-time optimizer.
The value is either &lsquo;<samp>1to1</samp>&rsquo; to specify a partitioning mirroring
the original source files or &lsquo;<samp>balanced</samp>&rsquo; to specify partitioning
into equally sized chunks (whenever possible) or &lsquo;<samp>max</samp>&rsquo; to create
new partition for every symbol where possible.  Specifying &lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo;
as an algorithm disables partitioning and streaming completely. 
The default value is &lsquo;<samp>balanced</samp>&rsquo;. While &lsquo;<samp>1to1</samp>&rsquo; can be used
as an workaround for various code ordering issues, the &lsquo;<samp>max</samp>&rsquo;
partitioning is intended for internal testing only.
The value &lsquo;<samp>one</samp>&rsquo; specifies that exactly one partition should be
used while the value &lsquo;<samp>none</samp>&rsquo; bypasses partitioning and executes
the link-time optimization step directly from the WPA phase.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto-odr-type-merging</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto_002dodr_002dtype_002dmerging"></a>
<p>Enable streaming of mangled types names of C++ types and their unification
at link time.  This increases size of LTO object files, but enables
diagnostics about One Definition Rule violations.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-flto-compression-level=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-flto_002dcompression_002dlevel"></a>
<p>This option specifies the level of compression used for intermediate
language written to LTO object files, and is only meaningful in
conjunction with LTO mode (<samp>-flto</samp>).  Valid
values are 0 (no compression) to 9 (maximum compression).  Values
outside this range are clamped to either 0 or 9.  If the option is not
given, a default balanced compression setting is used.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fuse-linker-plugin</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fuse_002dlinker_002dplugin"></a>
<p>Enables the use of a linker plugin during link-time optimization.  This
option relies on plugin support in the linker, which is available in gold
or in GNU ld 2.21 or newer.
</p>
<p>This option enables the extraction of object files with GIMPLE bytecode out
of library archives. This improves the quality of optimization by exposing
more code to the link-time optimizer.  This information specifies what
symbols can be accessed externally (by non-LTO object or during dynamic
linking).  Resulting code quality improvements on binaries (and shared
libraries that use hidden visibility) are similar to <samp>-fwhole-program</samp>.
See <samp>-flto</samp> for a description of the effect of this flag and how to
use it.
</p>
<p>This option is enabled by default when LTO support in GCC is enabled
and GCC was configured for use with
a linker supporting plugins (GNU ld 2.21 or newer or gold).
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-ffat-lto-objects</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-ffat_002dlto_002dobjects"></a>
<p>Fat LTO objects are object files that contain both the intermediate language
and the object code. This makes them usable for both LTO linking and normal
linking. This option is effective only when compiling with <samp>-flto</samp>
and is ignored at link time.
</p>
<p><samp>-fno-fat-lto-objects</samp> improves compilation time over plain LTO, but
requires the complete toolchain to be aware of LTO. It requires a linker with
linker plugin support for basic functionality.  Additionally,
<code>nm</code>, <code>ar</code> and <code>ranlib</code>
need to support linker plugins to allow a full-featured build environment
(capable of building static libraries etc).  GCC provides the <code>gcc-ar</code>,
<code>gcc-nm</code>, <code>gcc-ranlib</code> wrappers to pass the right options
to these tools. With non fat LTO makefiles need to be modified to use them.
</p>
<p>Note that modern binutils provide plugin auto-load mechanism.
Installing the linker plugin into <samp>$libdir/bfd-plugins</samp> has the same
effect as usage of the command wrappers (<code>gcc-ar</code>, <code>gcc-nm</code> and
<code>gcc-ranlib</code>).
</p>
<p>The default is <samp>-fno-fat-lto-objects</samp> on targets with linker plugin
support.

<p>Profiles collected using an instrumented binary for multi-threaded programs may

<p>By default, GCC emits an error message if the feedback profiles do not

<samp>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</samp>.  Note this may result in poorly
optimized code.  Additionally, by default, GCC also emits a warning message if
the feedback profiles do not exist (see <samp>-Wmissing-profile</samp>).

<p>The following options control compiler behavior regarding floating-point

</p>
<a name="index-floating_002dpoint-precision"></a>
<p>This option prevents undesirable excess precision on machines such as
the 68000 where the floating registers (of the 68881) keep more
precision than a <code>double</code> is supposed to have.  Similarly for the
x86 architecture.  For most programs, the excess precision does only
good, but a few programs rely on the precise definition of IEEE floating
point.  Use <samp>-ffloat-store</samp> for such programs, after modifying
them to store all pertinent intermediate computations into variables.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fexcess-precision=<var>style</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fexcess_002dprecision"></a>
<p>This option allows further control over excess precision on machines
where floating-point operations occur in a format with more precision or
range than the IEEE standard and interchange floating-point types.  By
default, <samp>-fexcess-precision=fast</samp> is in effect; this means that
operations may be carried out in a wider precision than the types specified
in the source if that would result in faster code, and it is unpredictable
when rounding to the types specified in the source code takes place.
When compiling C, if <samp>-fexcess-precision=standard</samp> is specified then
excess precision follows the rules specified in ISO C99; in particular,
both casts and assignments cause values to be rounded to their
semantic types (whereas <samp>-ffloat-store</samp> only affects
assignments).  This option is enabled by default for C if a strict
conformance option such as <samp>-std=c99</samp> is used.

<p>After running a program compiled with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp>

you can compile it a second time using
<samp>-fbranch-probabilities</samp>, to improve optimizations based on
the number of times each branch was taken.  When a program
compiled with <samp>-fprofile-arcs</samp> exits, it saves arc execution
counts to a file called <samp><var>sourcename</var>.gcda</samp> for each source
file.  The information in this data file is very dependent on the
structure of the generated code, so you must use the same source code
and the same optimization options for both compilations.

&lsquo;<samp>REG_BR_PROB</samp>&rsquo; note on each &lsquo;<samp>JUMP_INSN</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>CALL_INSN</samp>&rsquo;.
These can be used to improve optimization.  Currently, they are only
used in one place: in <samp>reorg.c</samp>, instead of guessing which path a

<dt><code>-frename-registers</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-frename_002dregisters"></a>
<p>Attempt to avoid false dependencies in scheduled code by making use
of registers left over after register allocation.  This optimization
most benefits processors with lots of registers.  Depending on the
debug information format adopted by the target, however, it can
make debugging impossible, since variables no longer stay in

<samp>-frerun-cse-after-loop</samp>, <samp>-fweb</samp> and <samp>-frename-registers</samp>.
It also turns on complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with

complete loop peeling (i.e. complete removal of loops with small constant
number of iterations).

<dt><code>-fversion-loops-for-strides</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fversion_002dloops_002dfor_002dstrides"></a>
<p>If a loop iterates over an array with a variable stride, create another
version of the loop that assumes the stride is always one.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
  x[i * stride] = &hellip;;
</pre></div>

<p>becomes:

<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">if (stride == 1)
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
    x[i] = &hellip;;
else
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)
    x[i * stride] = &hellip;;
</pre></div>

<p>This is particularly useful for assumed-shape arrays in Fortran where
(for example) it allows better vectorization assuming contiguous accesses.

<a name="index-fdata_002dsections"></a>
<p>Place each function or data item into its own section in the output
file if the target supports arbitrary sections.  The name of the
function or the name of the data item determines the section&rsquo;s name
in the output file.
</p>
<p>Use these options on systems where the linker can perform optimizations to
improve locality of reference in the instruction space.  Most systems using the
ELF object format have linkers with such optimizations.  On AIX, the linker
rearranges sections (CSECTs) based on the call graph.  The performance impact
varies.
</p>
<p>Together with a linker garbage collection (linker <samp>--gc-sections</samp>
option) these options may lead to smaller statically-linked executables (after
stripping).
</p>
<p>On ELF/DWARF systems these options do not degenerate the quality of the debug
information.  There could be issues with other object files/debug info formats.
</p>
<p>Only use these options when there are significant benefits from doing so.  When
you specify these options, the assembler and linker create larger object and
executable files and are also slower.  These options affect code generation.
They prevent optimizations by the compiler and assembler using relative
locations inside a translation unit since the locations are unknown until
link time.  An example of such an optimization is relaxing calls to short call
instructions.

<dd><a name="index-fsection_002danchors"></a>
<p>Try to reduce the number of symbolic address calculations by using
shared &ldquo;anchor&rdquo; symbols to address nearby objects.  This transformation
can help to reduce the number of GOT entries and GOT accesses on some
targets.
</p>
<p>For example, the implementation of the following function <code>foo</code>:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">static int a, b, c;
int foo (void) { return a + b + c; }
</pre></div>

<p>usually calculates the addresses of all three variables, but if you
compile it with <samp>-fsection-anchors</samp>, it accesses the variables
from a common anchor point instead.  The effect is similar to the
following pseudocode (which isn&rsquo;t valid C):
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">int foo (void)
{
  register int *xr = &amp;x;
  return xr[&amp;a - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;b - &amp;x] + xr[&amp;c - &amp;x];

A, the growth of unit is 300\% and yet such inlining is very sane.  For very
large units consisting of small inlineable functions, however, the overall unit
growth limit is needed to avoid exponential explosion of code size.  Thus for
