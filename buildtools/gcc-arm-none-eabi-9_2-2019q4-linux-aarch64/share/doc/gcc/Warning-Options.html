<h3 class="section">3.8 Options to Request or Suppress Warnings</h3>
<a name="index-options-to-control-warnings"></a>
<a name="index-warning-messages"></a>
<a name="index-messages_002c-warning"></a>
<a name="index-suppressing-warnings"></a>

<p>Warnings are diagnostic messages that report constructions that
are not inherently erroneous but that are risky or suggest there
may have been an error.
</p>
<p>The following language-independent options do not enable specific
warnings but control the kinds of diagnostics produced by GCC.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><a name="index-syntax-checking"></a>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fsyntax-only</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fsyntax_002donly"></a>
<p>Check the code for syntax errors, but don&rsquo;t do anything beyond that.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-fmax-errors=<var>n</var></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-fmax_002derrors"></a>
<p>Limits the maximum number of error messages to <var>n</var>, at which point
GCC bails out rather than attempting to continue processing the source
code.  If <var>n</var> is 0 (the default), there is no limit on the number
of error messages produced.  If <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> is also
specified, then <samp>-Wfatal-errors</samp> takes precedence over this
option.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-w</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-w"></a>
<p>Inhibit all warning messages.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002derror"></a>
<p>Make all warnings into errors.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Werror=</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Werror_003d"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002derror_003d"></a>
<p>Make the specified warning into an error.  The specifier for a warning
is appended; for example <samp>-Werror=switch</samp> turns the warnings
controlled by <samp>-Wswitch</samp> into errors.  This switch takes a
negative form, to be used to negate <samp>-Werror</samp> for specific
warnings; for example <samp>-Wno-error=switch</samp> makes
<samp>-Wswitch</samp> warnings not be errors, even when <samp>-Werror</samp>
is in effect.
</p>
<p>The warning message for each controllable warning includes the
option that controls the warning.  That option can then be used with
<samp>-Werror=</samp> and <samp>-Wno-error=</samp> as described above.
(Printing of the option in the warning message can be disabled using the
<samp>-fno-diagnostics-show-option</samp> flag.)
</p>
<p>Note that specifying <samp>-Werror=</samp><var>foo</var> automatically implies
<samp>-W</samp><var>foo</var>.  However, <samp>-Wno-error=</samp><var>foo</var> does not
imply anything.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wfatal-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wfatal_002derrors"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dfatal_002derrors"></a>
<p>This option causes the compiler to abort compilation on the first error
occurred rather than trying to keep going and printing further error
messages.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>You can request many specific warnings with options beginning with
&lsquo;<samp>-W</samp>&rsquo;, for example <samp>-Wimplicit</samp> to request warnings on
implicit declarations.  Each of these specific warning options also
has a negative form beginning &lsquo;<samp>-Wno-</samp>&rsquo; to turn off warnings; for
example, <samp>-Wno-implicit</samp>.  This manual lists only one of the
two forms, whichever is not the default.  For further
language-specific options also refer to <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and
<a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.
</p>
<p>Some options, such as <samp>-Wall</samp> and <samp>-Wextra</samp>, turn on other
options, such as <samp>-Wunused</samp>, which may turn on further options,
such as <samp>-Wunused-value</samp>. The combined effect of positive and
negative forms is that more specific options have priority over less
specific ones, independently of their position in the command-line. For
options of the same specificity, the last one takes effect. Options
enabled or disabled via pragmas (see <a href="Diagnostic-Pragmas.html#Diagnostic-Pragmas">Diagnostic Pragmas</a>) take effect
as if they appeared at the end of the command-line.
</p>
<p>When an unrecognized warning option is requested (e.g.,
<samp>-Wunknown-warning</samp>), GCC emits a diagnostic stating
that the option is not recognized.  However, if the <samp>-Wno-</samp> form
is used, the behavior is slightly different: no diagnostic is
produced for <samp>-Wno-unknown-warning</samp> unless other diagnostics
are being produced.  This allows the use of new <samp>-Wno-</samp> options
with old compilers, but if something goes wrong, the compiler
warns that an unrecognized option is present.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-Wpedantic</code></dt>
<dt><code>-pedantic</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic-1"></a>
<a name="index-Wpedantic"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dpedantic"></a>
<p>Issue all the warnings demanded by strict ISO C and ISO C++;
reject all programs that use forbidden extensions, and some other
programs that do not follow ISO C and ISO C++.  For ISO C, follows the
version of the ISO C standard specified by any <samp>-std</samp> option used.
</p>
<p>Valid ISO C and ISO C++ programs should compile properly with or without
this option (though a rare few require <samp>-ansi</samp> or a
<samp>-std</samp> option specifying the required version of ISO C).  However,
without this option, certain GNU extensions and traditional C and C++
features are supported as well.  With this option, they are rejected.
</p>
<p><samp>-Wpedantic</samp> does not cause warning messages for use of the
alternate keywords whose names begin and end with &lsquo;<samp>__</samp>&rsquo;.  Pedantic
warnings are also disabled in the expression that follows
<code>__extension__</code>.  However, only system header files should use
these escape routes; application programs should avoid them.
See <a href="Alternate-Keywords.html#Alternate-Keywords">Alternate Keywords</a>.
</p>
<p>Some users try to use <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> to check programs for strict ISO
C conformance.  They soon find that it does not do quite what they want:
it finds some non-ISO practices, but not all&mdash;only those for which
ISO C <em>requires</em> a diagnostic, and some others for which
diagnostics have been added.
</p>
<p>A feature to report any failure to conform to ISO C might be useful in
some instances, but would require considerable additional work and would
be quite different from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>.  We don&rsquo;t have plans to
support such a feature in the near future.
</p>
<p>Where the standard specified with <samp>-std</samp> represents a GNU
extended dialect of C, such as &lsquo;<samp>gnu90</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>gnu99</samp>&rsquo;, there is a
corresponding <em>base standard</em>, the version of ISO C on which the GNU
extended dialect is based.  Warnings from <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> are given
where they are required by the base standard.  (It does not make sense
for such warnings to be given only for features not in the specified GNU
C dialect, since by definition the GNU dialects of C include all
features the compiler supports with the given option, and there would be
nothing to warn about.)
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-pedantic-errors</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-pedantic_002derrors-1"></a>
<p>Give an error whenever the <em>base standard</em> (see <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>)
requires a diagnostic, in some cases where there is undefined behavior
at compile-time and in some other cases that do not prevent compilation
of programs that are valid according to the standard. This is not
equivalent to <samp>-Werror=pedantic</samp>, since there are errors enabled
by this option and not enabled by the latter and vice versa.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wall</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wall"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dall"></a>
<p>This enables all the warnings about constructions that some users
consider questionable, and that are easy to avoid (or modify to
prevent the warning), even in conjunction with macros.  This also
enables some language-specific warnings described in <a href="C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#C_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">C++ Dialect Options</a> and <a href="Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options.html#Objective_002dC-and-Objective_002dC_002b_002b-Dialect-Options">Objective-C and Objective-C++ Dialect Options</a>.
</p>
<p><samp>-Wall</samp> turns on the following warning flags:

<p>Note that some warning flags are not implied by <samp>-Wall</samp>.  Some of
them warn about constructions that users generally do not consider
questionable, but which occasionally you might wish to check for;
others warn about constructions that are necessary or hard to avoid in
some cases, and there is no simple way to modify the code to suppress
the warning. Some of them are enabled by <samp>-Wextra</samp> but many of
them must be enabled individually.

<p>The option <samp>-Wextra</samp> also prints warning messages for the
following cases:
</p>
<ul>
<li> A pointer is compared against integer zero with <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>,
<code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&gt;=</code>.

</li><li> (C++ only) An enumerator and a non-enumerator both appear in a

<p>Warn if an array subscript has type <code>char</code>.  This is a common cause
of error, as programmers often forget that this type is signed on some

This warning is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.

<p>Warn if feedback profiles do not match when using the
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp> option.
If a source file is changed between compiling with <samp>-fprofile-generate</samp>
and with <samp>-fprofile-use</samp>, the files with the profile feedback can fail
to match the source file and GCC cannot use the profile feedback
information.  By default, this warning is enabled and is treated as an
error.  <samp>-Wno-coverage-mismatch</samp> can be used to disable the
warning or <samp>-Wno-error=coverage-mismatch</samp> can be used to
disable the error.  Disabling the error for this warning can result in
poorly optimized code and is useful only in the
case of very minor changes such as bug fixes to an existing code-base.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended.

<p>Give a warning when a value of type <code>float</code> is implicitly
promoted to <code>double</code>.  CPUs with a 32-bit &ldquo;single-precision&rdquo;
floating-point unit implement <code>float</code> in hardware, but emulate
<code>double</code> in software.  On such a machine, doing computations
using <code>double</code> values is much more expensive because of the
overhead required for software emulation.
</p>
<p>It is easy to accidentally do computations with <code>double</code> because
floating-point literals are implicitly of type <code>double</code>.  For
example, in:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">float area(float radius)
{
   return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
}
</pre></div>

<p>Check calls to <code>printf</code> and <code>scanf</code>, etc., to make sure that
the arguments supplied have types appropriate to the format string
specified, and that the conversions specified in the format string make
sense.  This includes standard functions, and others specified by format
attributes (see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>), in the <code>printf</code>,
<code>scanf</code>, <code>strftime</code> and <code>strfmon</code> (an X/Open extension,
not in the C standard) families (or other target-specific families).
Which functions are checked without format attributes having been
specified depends on the standard version selected, and such checks of
functions without the attribute specified are disabled by
<samp>-ffreestanding</samp> or <samp>-fno-builtin</samp>.
</p>
<p>The formats are checked against the format features supported by GNU
libc version 2.2.  These include all ISO C90 and C99 features, as well
as features from the Single Unix Specification and some BSD and GNU
extensions.  Other library implementations may not support all these
features; GCC does not support warning about features that go beyond a
particular library&rsquo;s limitations.  However, if <samp>-Wpedantic</samp> is used
with <samp>-Wformat</samp>, warnings are given about format features not
in the selected standard version (but not for <code>strfmon</code> formats,
since those are not in any version of the C standard).  See <a href="C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options">Options Controlling C Dialect</a>.

<p>Option <samp>-Wformat</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wformat=1</samp>, and
<samp>-Wno-format</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wformat=0</samp>.  Since
<samp>-Wformat</samp> also checks for null format arguments for several
functions, <samp>-Wformat</samp> also implies <samp>-Wnonnull</samp>.  Some
aspects of this level of format checking can be disabled by the
options: <samp>-Wno-format-contains-nul</samp>,
<samp>-Wno-format-extra-args</samp>, and <samp>-Wno-format-zero-length</samp>.
<samp>-Wformat</samp> is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.

<p>If <samp>-Wformat</samp> is specified, do not warn about excess arguments to a
<code>printf</code> or <code>scanf</code> format function.  The C standard specifies
that such arguments are ignored.
</p>
<p>Where the unused arguments lie between used arguments that are
specified with &lsquo;<samp>$</samp>&rsquo; operand number specifications, normally
warnings are still given, since the implementation could not know what
type to pass to <code>va_arg</code> to skip the unused arguments.  However,
in the case of <code>scanf</code> formats, this option suppresses the
warning if the unused arguments are all pointers, since the Single
Unix Specification says that such unused arguments are allowed.

<p>Warn about calls to formatted input/output functions such as <code>sprintf</code>
and <code>vsprintf</code> that might overflow the destination buffer.  When the
exact number of bytes written by a format directive cannot be determined
at compile-time it is estimated based on heuristics that depend on the
<var>level</var> argument and on optimization.  While enabling optimization
will in most cases improve the accuracy of the warning, it may also
result in false positives.

<a name="index-Wno_002dformat_002doverflow-1"></a>
<p>Level <var>1</var> of <samp>-Wformat-overflow</samp> enabled by <samp>-Wformat</samp>
employs a conservative approach that warns only about calls that most
likely overflow the buffer.  At this level, numeric arguments to format
directives with unknown values are assumed to have the value of one, and
strings of unknown length to be empty.  Numeric arguments that are known
to be bounded to a subrange of their type, or string arguments whose output
is bounded either by their directive&rsquo;s precision or by a finite set of
string literals, are assumed to take on the value within the range that
results in the most bytes on output.  For example, the call to <code>sprintf</code>
below is diagnosed because even with both <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> equal to zero,
the terminating NUL character (<code>'\0'</code>) appended by the function
to the destination buffer will be written past its end.  Increasing
the size of the buffer by a single byte is sufficient to avoid the
warning, though it may not be sufficient to avoid the overflow.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void f (int a, int b)
{
  char buf [13];
  sprintf (buf, &quot;a = %i, b = %i\n&quot;, a, b);
}
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><code>-Wformat-overflow=2</code></dt>
<dd><p>Level <var>2</var> warns also about calls that might overflow the destination
buffer given an argument of sufficient length or magnitude.  At level
<var>2</var>, unknown numeric arguments are assumed to have the minimum
representable value for signed types with a precision greater than 1, and
the maximum representable value otherwise.  Unknown string arguments whose
length cannot be assumed to be bounded either by the directive&rsquo;s precision,
or by a finite set of string literals they may evaluate to, or the character
array they may point to, are assumed to be 1 character long.
</p>
<p>At level <var>2</var>, the call in the example above is again diagnosed, but
this time because with <var>a</var> equal to a 32-bit <code>INT_MIN</code> the first
<code>%i</code> directive will write some of its digits beyond the end of
the destination buffer.  To make the call safe regardless of the values
of the two variables, the size of the destination buffer must be increased
to at least 34 bytes.  GCC includes the minimum size of the buffer in
an informational note following the warning.
</p>
<p>An alternative to increasing the size of the destination buffer is to
constrain the range of formatted values.  The maximum length of string
arguments can be bounded by specifying the precision in the format
directive.  When numeric arguments of format directives can be assumed
to be bounded by less than the precision of their type, choosing
an appropriate length modifier to the format specifier will reduce
the required buffer size.  For example, if <var>a</var> and <var>b</var> in the
example above can be assumed to be within the precision of
the <code>short int</code> type then using either the <code>%hi</code> format
directive or casting the argument to <code>short</code> reduces the maximum
required size of the buffer to 24 bytes.
</p>

<pre class="smallexample">void f (int a, int b)

<p>Warn when a switch case falls through.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">switch (cond)
  {
  case 1:
    a = 1;
    break;
  case 2:
    a = 2;
  case 3:
    a = 3;
    break;
  }
</pre></div>

<p>This warning does not warn when the last statement of a case cannot
fall through, e.g. when there is a return statement or a call to function
declared with the noreturn attribute.  <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=</samp>
also takes into account control flow statements, such as ifs, and only
warns when appropriate.  E.g.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">switch (cond)
  {
  case 1:
    if (i &gt; 3) {
      bar (5);
      break;
    } else if (i &lt; 1) {
      bar (0);
    } else
      return;
  default:
    &hellip;
  }
</pre></div>

<p>Since there are occasions where a switch case fall through is desirable,
GCC provides an attribute, <code>__attribute__ ((fallthrough))</code>, that is
to be used along with a null statement to suppress this warning that
would normally occur:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">switch (cond)
  {
  case 1:
    bar (0);
    __attribute__ ((fallthrough));
  default:
    &hellip;
  }
</pre></div>

<p>C++17 provides a standard way to suppress the <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough</samp>
warning using <code>[[fallthrough]];</code> instead of the GNU attribute.  In C++11
or C++14 users can use <code>[[gnu::fallthrough]];</code>, which is a GNU extension.
Instead of these attributes, it is also possible to add a fallthrough comment
to silence the warning.  The whole body of the C or C++ style comment should
match the given regular expressions listed below.  The option argument <var>n</var>
specifies what kind of comments are accepted:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=0</samp> disables the warning altogether.

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=1</samp> matches <code>.*</code> regular
expression, any comment is used as fallthrough comment.

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=2</samp> case insensitively matches
<code>.*falls?[ \t-]*thr(ough|u).*</code> regular expression.

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=3</samp> case sensitively matches one of the

</li><li> <code>[ \t.!]*([Ee]lse,? |[Ii]ntentional(ly)? )?<br>fall(s | |-)?thr(ough|u)[ \t.!]*(-[^\n\r]*)?</code>

</li></ul>

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=4</samp> case sensitively matches one of the
following regular expressions:

<ul>
<li> <code>-fallthrough</code>

</li><li> <code>@fallthrough@</code>

</li><li> <code>[ \t]*FALLTHR(OUGH|U)[ \t]*</code>

</li></ul>

</li><li> <samp>-Wimplicit-fallthrough=5</samp> doesn&rsquo;t recognize any comments as

Specifically, a warning is issued for <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>while</code>, and
<code>for</code> clauses with a guarded statement that does not use braces,
followed by an unguarded statement with the same indentation.
</p>
<p>In the following example, the call to &ldquo;bar&rdquo; is misleadingly indented as

<pre class="smallexample">  if (some_condition ())
    foo ();
    bar ();  /* Gotcha: this is not guarded by the &quot;if&quot;.  */
</pre></div>

<p>In the case of mixed tabs and spaces, the warning uses the
<samp>-ftabstop=</samp> option to determine if the statements line up
(defaulting to 8).
</p>
<p>The warning is not issued for code involving multiline preprocessor logic
such as the following example.

    foo (0);
#if SOME_CONDITION_THAT_DOES_NOT_HOLD
  if (flagB)
#endif
    foo (1);
</pre></div>

<p>The warning is not issued after a <code>#line</code> directive, since this
typically indicates autogenerated code, and no assumptions can be made
about the layout of the file that the directive references.
</p>
<p>This warning is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp> in C and C++.

<dt><code>-Wmissing-attributes</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wmissing_002dattributes"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dmissing_002dattributes"></a>
<p>Warn when a declaration of a function is missing one or more attributes
that a related function is declared with and whose absence may adversely
affect the correctness or efficiency of generated code.  For example,
the warning is issued for declarations of aliases that use attributes
to specify less restrictive requirements than those of their targets.
This typically represents a potential optimization opportunity.
By contrast, the <samp>-Wattribute-alias=2</samp> option controls warnings
issued when the alias is more restrictive than the target, which could
lead to incorrect code generation.
Attributes considered include <code>alloc_align</code>, <code>alloc_size</code>,
<code>cold</code>, <code>const</code>, <code>hot</code>, <code>leaf</code>, <code>malloc</code>,
<code>nonnull</code>, <code>noreturn</code>, <code>nothrow</code>, <code>pure</code>,
<code>returns_nonnull</code>, and <code>returns_twice</code>.
</p>
<p>In C++, the warning is issued when an explicit specialization of a primary
template declared with attribute <code>alloc_align</code>, <code>alloc_size</code>,
<code>assume_aligned</code>, <code>format</code>, <code>format_arg</code>, <code>malloc</code>,
or <code>nonnull</code> is declared without it.  Attributes <code>deprecated</code>,
<code>error</code>, and <code>warning</code> suppress the warning.
(see <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>).
</p>
<p>You can use the <code>copy</code> attribute to apply the same
set of attributes to a declaration as that on another declaration without
explicitly enumerating the attributes. This attribute can be applied
to declarations of functions (see <a href="Common-Function-Attributes.html#Common-Function-Attributes">Common Function Attributes</a>),
variables (see <a href="Common-Variable-Attributes.html#Common-Variable-Attributes">Common Variable Attributes</a>), or types
(see <a href="Common-Type-Attributes.html#Common-Type-Attributes">Common Type Attributes</a>).
</p>
<p><samp>-Wmissing-attributes</samp> is enabled by <samp>-Wall</samp>.
</p>
<p>For example, since the declaration of the primary function template
below makes use of both attribute <code>malloc</code> and <code>alloc_size</code>
the declaration of the explicit specialization of the template is
diagnosed because it is missing one of the attributes.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">

<a name="index-Wno_002dmissing_002dprofile"></a>
<p>Warn if feedback profiles are missing when using the
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp> option.
This option diagnoses those cases where a new function or a new file is added
to the user code between compiling with <samp>-fprofile-generate</samp> and with
<samp>-fprofile-use</samp>, without regenerating the profiles.  In these cases, the
profile feedback data files do not contain any profile feedback information for
the newly added function or file respectively.  Also, in the case when profile
count data (.gcda) files are removed, GCC cannot use any profile feedback
information.  In all these cases, warnings are issued to inform the user that a
profile generation step is due.  <samp>-Wno-missing-profile</samp> can be used to
disable the warning.  Ignoring the warning can result in poorly optimized code.
Completely disabling the warning is not recommended and should be done only

<p>Warn about unsafe multiple statement macros that appear to be guarded
by a clause such as <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>, <code>switch</code>, or
<code>while</code>, in which only the first statement is actually guarded after
the macro is expanded.
</p>
<p>For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define DOIT x++; y++
if (c)
  DOIT;
</pre></div>

<p>will increment <code>y</code> unconditionally, not just when <code>c</code> holds.
The can usually be fixed by wrapping the macro in a do-while loop:
</p><div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">#define DOIT do { x++; y++; } while (0)
if (c)
  DOIT;

<p>Warn if parentheses are omitted in certain contexts, such
as when there is an assignment in a context where a truth value
is expected, or when operators are nested whose precedence people
often get confused about.
</p>
<p>Also warn if a comparison like <code>x&lt;=y&lt;=z</code> appears; this is
equivalent to <code>(x&lt;=y ? 1 : 0) &lt;= z</code>, which is a different
interpretation from that of ordinary mathematical notation.
</p>
<p>Also warn for dangerous uses of the GNU extension to
<code>?:</code> with omitted middle operand. When the condition
in the <code>?</code>: operator is a boolean expression, the omitted value is
always 1.  Often programmers expect it to be a value computed
inside the conditional expression instead.
</p>
<p>For C++ this also warns for some cases of unnecessary parentheses in
declarations, which can indicate an attempt at a function call instead
of a declaration:
</p><div class="smallexample">

</p>
<p>The C and C++ standards define the order in which expressions in a C/C++
program are evaluated in terms of <em>sequence points</em>, which represent
a partial ordering between the execution of parts of the program: those
executed before the sequence point, and those executed after it.  These
occur after the evaluation of a full expression (one which is not part
of a larger expression), after the evaluation of the first operand of a
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>? :</code> or <code>,</code> (comma) operator, before a
function is called (but after the evaluation of its arguments and the
expression denoting the called function), and in certain other places.
Other than as expressed by the sequence point rules, the order of
evaluation of subexpressions of an expression is not specified.  All
these rules describe only a partial order rather than a total order,
since, for example, if two functions are called within one expression
with no sequence point between them, the order in which the functions
are called is not specified.  However, the standards committee have
ruled that function calls do not overlap.
</p>
<p>It is not specified when between sequence points modifications to the
values of objects take effect.  Programs whose behavior depends on this
have undefined behavior; the C and C++ standards specify that &ldquo;Between
the previous and next sequence point an object shall have its stored
value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression.
Furthermore, the prior value shall be read only to determine the value
to be stored.&rdquo;.  If a program breaks these rules, the results on any
particular implementation are entirely unpredictable.
</p>
<p>Examples of code with undefined behavior are <code>a = a++;</code>, <code>a[n]
= b[n++]</code> and <code>a[i++] = i;</code>.  Some more complicated cases are not
diagnosed by this option, and it may give an occasional false positive
result, but in general it has been found fairly effective at detecting
this sort of problem in programs.
</p>
<p>The C++17 standard will define the order of evaluation of operands in
more cases: in particular it requires that the right-hand side of an
assignment be evaluated before the left-hand side, so the above
examples are no longer undefined.  But this warning will still warn
about them, to help people avoid writing code that is undefined in C
and earlier revisions of C++.
</p>
<p>The standard is worded confusingly, therefore there is some debate
over the precise meaning of the sequence point rules in subtle cases.

definitions, may be found on the GCC readings page, at

warn if a non-static reference or non-static <code>const</code> member

<p>For an automatic (i.e. local) variable, if there exists a path from the
function entry to a use of the variable that is initialized, but there exist
some other paths for which the variable is not initialized, the compiler
emits a warning if it cannot prove the uninitialized paths are not
executed at run time.
</p>
<p>These warnings are only possible in optimizing compilation, because otherwise
GCC does not keep track of the state of variables.
</p>
<p>These warnings are made optional because GCC may not be able to determine when
the code is correct in spite of appearing to have an error.  Here is one
example of how this can happen:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">{
  int x;
  switch (y)

    case 1: x = 1;
      break;
    case 2: x = 4;
      break;
    case 3: x = 5;
    }
  foo (x);
}
</pre></div>

<p>If the value of <code>y</code> is always 1, 2 or 3, then <code>x</code> is
always initialized, but GCC doesn&rsquo;t know this. To suppress the
warning, you need to provide a default case with assert(0) or
similar code.
</p>
<a name="index-longjmp-warnings"></a>
<p>This option also warns when a non-volatile automatic variable might be
changed by a call to <code>longjmp</code>.
The compiler sees only the calls to <code>setjmp</code>.  It cannot know
where <code>longjmp</code> will be called; in fact, a signal handler could
call it at any point in the code.  As a result, you may get a warning
even when there is in fact no problem because <code>longjmp</code> cannot
in fact be called at the place that would cause a problem.
</p>
<p>Some spurious warnings can be avoided if you declare all the functions
you use that never return as <code>noreturn</code>.  See <a href="Function-Attributes.html#Function-Attributes">Function Attributes</a>.

Higher levels correspond to higher accuracy (fewer false positives).

<samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp> is equivalent to <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing=3</samp>.
</p>
<p>Level 1: Most aggressive, quick, least accurate.
Possibly useful when higher levels
do not warn but <samp>-fstrict-aliasing</samp> still breaks the code, as it has very few
false negatives.  However, it has many false positives.
Warns for all pointer conversions between possibly incompatible types,
even if never dereferenced.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 2: Aggressive, quick, not too precise.
May still have many false positives (not as many as level 1 though),
and few false negatives (but possibly more than level 1).
Unlike level 1, it only warns when an address is taken.  Warns about
incomplete types.  Runs in the front end only.
</p>
<p>Level 3 (default for <samp>-Wstrict-aliasing</samp>):
Should have very few false positives and few false
negatives.  Slightly slower than levels 1 or 2 when optimization is enabled.
Takes care of the common pun+dereference pattern in the front end:
<code>*(int*)&amp;some_float</code>.
If optimization is enabled, it also runs in the back end, where it deals
with multiple statement cases using flow-sensitive points-to information.
Only warns when the converted pointer is dereferenced.
Does not warn about incomplete types.

<p>This option is only active when signed overflow is undefined.
It warns about cases where the compiler optimizes based on the
assumption that signed overflow does not occur.  Note that it does not
warn about all cases where the code might overflow: it only warns
about cases where the compiler implements some optimization.  Thus
this warning depends on the optimization level.
</p>
<p>An optimization that assumes that signed overflow does not occur is
perfectly safe if the values of the variables involved are such that
overflow never does, in fact, occur.  Therefore this warning can
easily give a false positive: a warning about code that is not
actually a problem.  To help focus on important issues, several
warning levels are defined.  No warnings are issued for the use of
undefined signed overflow when estimating how many iterations a loop
requires, in particular when determining whether a loop will be
executed at all.

<p>Warn for calls to string manipulation functions such as <code>memcpy</code> and
<code>strcpy</code> that are determined to overflow the destination buffer.  The
optional argument is one greater than the type of Object Size Checking to
perform to determine the size of the destination.  See <a href="Object-Size-Checking.html#Object-Size-Checking">Object Size Checking</a>.
The argument is meaningful only for functions that operate on character arrays
but not for raw memory functions like <code>memcpy</code> which always make use
of Object Size type-0.  The option also warns for calls that specify a size
in excess of the largest possible object or at most <code>SIZE_MAX / 2</code> bytes.
The option produces the best results with optimization enabled but can detect
a small subset of simple buffer overflows even without optimization in
calls to the GCC built-in functions like <code>__builtin_memcpy</code> that
correspond to the standard functions.  In any case, the option warns about
just a subset of buffer overflows detected by the corresponding overflow
checking built-ins.  For example, the option will issue a warning for
the <code>strcpy</code> call below because it copies at least 5 characters
(the string <code>&quot;blue&quot;</code> including the terminating NUL) into the buffer
of size 4.

<p>Warn for calls to bounded string manipulation functions such as <code>strncat</code>,
<code>strncpy</code>, and <code>stpncpy</code> that may either truncate the copied string
or leave the destination unchanged.
</p>
<p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncat</code> specifies a bound that
is less than the length of the source string.  As a result, the copy of
the source will be truncated and so the call is diagnosed.  To avoid the
warning use <code>bufsize - strlen (buf) - 1)</code> as the bound.

<pre class="smallexample">void append (char *buf, size_t bufsize)

  strncat (buf, &quot;.txt&quot;, 3);
}
</pre></div>

<p>As another example, the following call to <code>strncpy</code> results in copying
to <code>d</code> just the characters preceding the terminating NUL, without
appending the NUL to the end.  Assuming the result of <code>strncpy</code> is
necessarily a NUL-terminated string is a common mistake, and so the call
is diagnosed.  To avoid the warning when the result is not expected to be
NUL-terminated, call <code>memcpy</code> instead.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void copy (char *d, const char *s)
{
  strncpy (d, s, strlen (s));
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the following example, the call to <code>strncpy</code> specifies the size
of the destination buffer as the bound.  If the length of the source
string is equal to or greater than this size the result of the copy will
not be NUL-terminated.  Therefore, the call is also diagnosed.  To avoid
the warning, specify <code>sizeof buf - 1</code> as the bound and set the last
element of the buffer to <code>NUL</code>.
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void copy (const char *s)

<p>In situations where a character array is intended to store a sequence
of bytes with no terminating <code>NUL</code> such an array may be annotated
with attribute <code>nonstring</code> to avoid this warning.  Such arrays,
however, are not suitable arguments to functions that expect

such arrays GCC issues warnings unless it can prove that the use is
safe.  See <a href="Common-Variable-Attributes.html#Common-Variable-Attributes">Common Variable Attributes</a>.

GCC guesses that function pointers with <code>format</code> attributes that

resulting type.  I.e. the left-hand side of the assignment or
initialization, the type of the parameter variable, or the return type

</p>
<p>GCC also warns about function definitions that might be

appropriate may not be detected.

<dd><a name="index-Walloca_002dlarger_002dthan_003d"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dalloca_002dlarger_002dthan"></a>
<p>This option warns on calls to <code>alloca</code> with an integer argument whose
value is either zero, or that is not bounded by a controlling predicate
that limits its value to at most <var>byte-size</var>.  It also warns for calls
to <code>alloca</code> where the bound value is unknown.  Arguments of non-integer
types are considered unbounded even if they appear to be constrained to
the expected range.
</p>
<p>For example, a bounded case of <code>alloca</code> could be:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func (size_t n)
{
  void *p;
  if (n &lt;= 1000)
    p = alloca (n);
  else
    p = malloc (n);
  f (p);
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, passing <code>-Walloca-larger-than=1000</code> would not
issue a warning because the call to <code>alloca</code> is known to be at most
1000 bytes.  However, if <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed,
the compiler would emit a warning.
</p>
<p>Unbounded uses, on the other hand, are uses of <code>alloca</code> with no
controlling predicate constraining its integer argument.  For example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func ()
{
  void *p = alloca (n);
  f (p);
}
</pre></div>

<p>If <code>-Walloca-larger-than=500</code> were passed, the above would trigger
a warning, but this time because of the lack of bounds checking.
</p>
<p>Note, that even seemingly correct code involving signed integers could
cause a warning:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">void func (signed int n)
{
  if (n &lt; 500)
    {
      p = alloca (n);
      f (p);
    }
}
</pre></div>

<p>In the above example, <var>n</var> could be negative, causing a larger than
expected argument to be implicitly cast into the <code>alloca</code> call.
</p>
<p>This option also warns when <code>alloca</code> is used in a loop.

<p>Warn about trampolines generated for pointers to nested functions.
A trampoline is a small piece of data or code that is created at run
time on the stack when the address of a nested function is taken, and is
used to call the nested function indirectly.  For some targets, it is
made up of data only and thus requires no special treatment.  But, for
most targets, it is made up of code and thus requires the stack to be
made executable in order for the program to work properly.

<p>Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.
</p>
<p>The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the
programmer) to consider floating-point values as approximations to
infinitely precise real numbers.  If you are doing this, then you need
to compute (by analyzing the code, or in some other way) the maximum or
likely maximum error that the computation introduces, and allow for it
when performing comparisons (and when producing output, but that&rsquo;s a
different problem).  In particular, instead of testing for equality, you
should check to see whether the two values have ranges that overlap; and
this is done with the relational operators, so equality comparisons are
probably mistaken.

<dt><code>-Wtraditional <span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wtraditional"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dtraditional"></a>
<p>Warn about certain constructs that behave differently in traditional and
ISO C.  Also warn about ISO C constructs that have no traditional C
equivalent, and/or problematic constructs that should be avoided.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Macro parameters that appear within string literals in the macro body.
In traditional C macro replacement takes place within string literals,
but in ISO C it does not.

</li><li> In traditional C, some preprocessor directives did not exist.
Traditional preprocessors only considered a line to be a directive
if the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; appeared in column 1 on the line.  Therefore
<samp>-Wtraditional</samp> warns about directives that traditional C
understands but ignores because the &lsquo;<samp>#</samp>&rsquo; does not appear as the
first character on the line.  It also suggests you hide directives like
<code>#pragma</code> not understood by traditional C by indenting them.  Some
traditional implementations do not recognize <code>#elif</code>, so this option
suggests avoiding it altogether.

</li><li> A function-like macro that appears without arguments.

</li><li> The unary plus operator.

</li><li> The &lsquo;<samp>U</samp>&rsquo; integer constant suffix, or the &lsquo;<samp>F</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>L</samp>&rsquo; floating-point
constant suffixes.  (Traditional C does support the &lsquo;<samp>L</samp>&rsquo; suffix on integer
constants.)  Note, these suffixes appear in macros defined in the system
headers of most modern systems, e.g. the &lsquo;<samp>_MIN</samp>&rsquo;/&lsquo;<samp>_MAX</samp>&rsquo; macros in <code>&lt;limits.h&gt;</code>.
Use of these macros in user code might normally lead to spurious
warnings, however GCC&rsquo;s integrated preprocessor has enough context to
avoid warning in these cases.

</li><li> A function declared external in one block and then used after the end of
the block.

</li><li> A <code>switch</code> statement has an operand of type <code>long</code>.

</li><li> A non-<code>static</code> function declaration follows a <code>static</code> one.
This construct is not accepted by some traditional C compilers.

</li><li> The ISO type of an integer constant has a different width or
signedness from its traditional type.  This warning is only issued if
the base of the constant is ten.  I.e. hexadecimal or octal values, which
typically represent bit patterns, are not warned about.

</li><li> Usage of ISO string concatenation is detected.

</li><li> Initialization of automatic aggregates.

</li><li> Identifier conflicts with labels.  Traditional C lacks a separate
namespace for labels.

</li><li> Initialization of unions.  If the initializer is zero, the warning is
omitted.  This is done under the assumption that the zero initializer in
user code appears conditioned on e.g. <code>__STDC__</code> to avoid missing
initializer warnings and relies on default initialization to zero in the
traditional C case.

</li><li> Conversions by prototypes between fixed/floating-point values and vice
versa.  The absence of these prototypes when compiling with traditional
C causes serious problems.  This is a subset of the possible
conversion warnings; for the full set use <samp>-Wtraditional-conversion</samp>.

</li><li> Use of ISO C style function definitions.  This warning intentionally is
<em>not</em> issued for prototype declarations or variadic functions
because these ISO C features appear in your code when using
libiberty&rsquo;s traditional C compatibility macros, <code>PARAMS</code> and
<code>VPARAMS</code>.  This warning is also bypassed for nested functions
because that feature is already a GCC extension and thus not relevant to
traditional C compatibility.

<dt><code>-Wshadow=compatible-local</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wshadow_003dcompatible_002dlocal"></a>
<p>Warn when a local variable shadows another local variable or parameter
whose type is compatible with that of the shadowing variable. In C++,
type compatibility here means the type of the shadowing variable can be
converted to that of the shadowed variable. The creation of this flag
(in addition to <samp>-Wshadow=local</samp>) is based on the idea that when
a local variable shadows another one of incompatible type, it is most
likely intentional, not a bug or typo, as shown in the following example:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">for (SomeIterator i = SomeObj.begin(); i != SomeObj.end(); ++i)
{
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; N; ++i)
  {
    ...
  }
  ...
}
</pre></div>

<p>Since the two variable <code>i</code> in the example above have incompatible types,
enabling only <samp>-Wshadow=compatible-local</samp> will not emit a warning.
Because their types are incompatible, if a programmer accidentally uses one
in place of the other, type checking will catch that and emit an error or
warning. So not warning (about shadowing) in this case will not lead to
undetected bugs. Use of this flag instead of <samp>-Wshadow=local</samp> can
possibly reduce the number of warnings triggered by intentional shadowing.

<p>This warning is enabled by <samp>-Wshadow=local</samp>.

<p>Warn when a function pointer is cast to an incompatible function pointer.
In a cast involving function types with a variable argument list only

Any parameter of pointer-type matches any other pointer-type.  Any benign
differences in integral types are ignored, like <code>int</code> vs. <code>long</code>

a type B with no or internal linkage, defining it in multiple

<p>In C/C++, every <code>else</code> branch belongs to the innermost possible
<code>if</code> statement, which in this example is <code>if (b)</code>.  This is
often not what the programmer expected, as illustrated in the above
example by indentation the programmer chose.  When there is the
potential for this confusion, GCC issues a warning when this flag
is specified.  To eliminate the warning, add explicit braces around
the innermost <code>if</code> statement so there is no way the <code>else</code>
can belong to the enclosing <code>if</code>.  The resulting code
looks like this:

<p>In ISO C and ISO C++, two identifiers are different if they are
different sequences of characters.  However, sometimes when characters
outside the basic ASCII character set are used, you can have two
different character sequences that look the same.  To avoid confusion,
the ISO 10646 standard sets out some <em>normalization rules</em> which
when applied ensure that two sequences that look the same are turned into
the same sequence.  GCC can warn you if you are using identifiers that
have not been normalized; this option controls that warning.
</p>
<p>There are four levels of warning supported by GCC.  The default is
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfc</samp>, which warns about any identifier that is
not in the ISO 10646 &ldquo;C&rdquo; normalized form, <em>NFC</em>.  NFC is the
recommended form for most uses.  It is equivalent to
<samp>-Wnormalized</samp>.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are some characters allowed in identifiers by
ISO C and ISO C++ that, when turned into NFC, are not allowed in 
identifiers.  That is, there&rsquo;s no way to use these symbols in portable
ISO C or C++ and have all your identifiers in NFC.
<samp>-Wnormalized=id</samp> suppresses the warning for these characters.
It is hoped that future versions of the standards involved will correct
this, which is why this option is not the default.
</p>
<p>You can switch the warning off for all characters by writing
<samp>-Wnormalized=none</samp> or <samp>-Wno-normalized</samp>.  You should
only do this if you are using some other normalization scheme (like
&ldquo;D&rdquo;), because otherwise you can easily create bugs that are
literally impossible to see.
</p>
<p>Some characters in ISO 10646 have distinct meanings but look identical
in some fonts or display methodologies, especially once formatting has
been applied.  For instance <code>\u207F</code>, &ldquo;SUPERSCRIPT LATIN SMALL
LETTER N&rdquo;, displays just like a regular <code>n</code> that has been
placed in a superscript.  ISO 10646 defines the <em>NFKC</em>
normalization scheme to convert all these into a standard form as
well, and GCC warns if your code is not in NFKC if you use
<samp>-Wnormalized=nfkc</samp>.  This warning is comparable to warning
about every identifier that contains the letter O because it might be
confused with the digit 0, and so is not the default, but may be
useful as a local coding convention if the programming environment 
cannot be fixed to display these characters distinctly.

<a name="index-Wno_002ddisabled_002doptimization"></a>
<p>Warn if a requested optimization pass is disabled.  This warning does
not generally indicate that there is anything wrong with your code; it
merely indicates that GCC&rsquo;s optimizers are unable to handle the code
effectively.  Often, the problem is that your code is too big or too
complex; GCC refuses to optimize programs when the optimization
itself is likely to take inordinate amounts of time.

<dt><code>-Wpointer-sign <span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wpointer_002dsign"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dpointer_002dsign"></a>
<p>Warn for pointer argument passing or assignment with different signedness.
This option is only supported for C and Objective-C.  It is implied by
<samp>-Wall</samp> and by <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>, which can be disabled with
<samp>-Wno-pointer-sign</samp>.

<dt><code>-Wstack-protector</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Wstack_002dprotector"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002dstack_002dprotector"></a>
<p>This option is only active when <samp>-fstack-protector</samp> is active.  It
warns about functions that are not protected against stack smashing.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Woverlength-strings</code></dt>
<dd><a name="index-Woverlength_002dstrings"></a>
<a name="index-Wno_002doverlength_002dstrings"></a>
<p>Warn about string constants that are longer than the &ldquo;minimum
maximum&rdquo; length specified in the C standard.  Modern compilers
generally allow string constants that are much longer than the
standard&rsquo;s minimum limit, but very portable programs should avoid
using longer strings.
</p>
<p>The limit applies <em>after</em> string constant concatenation, and does
not count the trailing NUL.  In C90, the limit was 509 characters; in
C99, it was raised to 4095.  C++98 does not specify a normative
minimum maximum, so we do not diagnose overlength strings in C++.
</p>
<p>This option is implied by <samp>-Wpedantic</samp>, and can be disabled with
<samp>-Wno-overlength-strings</samp>.

<a name="index-Wno_002dunsuffixed_002dfloat_002dconstants"></a>

<p>Issue a warning for any floating constant that does not have
a suffix.  When used together with <samp>-Wsystem-headers</samp> it
warns about such constants in system header files.  This can be useful
when preparing code to use with the <code>FLOAT_CONST_DECIMAL64</code> pragma
from the decimal floating-point extension to C99.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Wno-designated-init <span class="roman">(C and Objective-C only)</span></code></dt>
<dd><p>Suppress warnings when a positional initializer is used to initialize
a structure that has been marked with the <code>designated_init</code>
attribute.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>-Whsa</code></dt>
<dd><p>Issue a warning when HSAIL cannot be emitted for the compiled function or
OpenMP construct.
