<p>Binutils pre 2.24 does not have support for selecting <samp>-mabi</samp> and
does not support ILP32.  If it is used to build GCC 4.9 or later, GCC will
not support option <samp>-mabi=ilp32</samp>.
</p>
<p>To enable a workaround for the Cortex-A53 erratum number 835769 by default
(for all CPUs regardless of -mcpu option given) at configure time use the
<samp>--enable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</samp> option.  This will enable the fix by
default and can be explicitly disabled during compilation by passing the
<samp>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-835769</samp> option.  Conversely,
<samp>--disable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</samp> will disable the workaround by
default.  The workaround is disabled by default if neither of
<samp>--enable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</samp> or
<samp>--disable-fix-cortex-a53-835769</samp> is given at configure time.
</p>
<p>To enable a workaround for the Cortex-A53 erratum number 843419 by default
(for all CPUs regardless of -mcpu option given) at configure time use the
<samp>--enable-fix-cortex-a53-843419</samp> option.  This workaround is applied at
link time.  Enabling the workaround will cause GCC to pass the relevant option
to the linker.  It can be explicitly disabled during compilation by passing the
<samp>-mno-fix-cortex-a53-843419</samp> option.  Conversely,
<samp>--disable-fix-cortex-a53-843419</samp> will disable the workaround by default.
The workaround is disabled by default if neither of
<samp>--enable-fix-cortex-a53-843419</samp> or
<samp>--disable-fix-cortex-a53-843419</samp> is given at configure time.
</p>
<p>To enable Branch Target Identification Mechanism and Return Address Signing by
default at configure time use the <samp>--enable-standard-branch-protection</samp>
option.  This is equivalent to having <samp>-mbranch-protection=standard</samp>
during compilation.  This can be explicitly disabled during compilation by
passing the <samp>-mbranch-protection=none</samp> option which turns off all
types of branch protections.  Conversely,
<samp>--disable-standard-branch-protection</samp> will disable both the
protections by default.  This mechanism is turned off by default if neither
of the options are given at configure time.

<h3 class="heading">*-*-freebsd*</h3>
<p>Support for FreeBSD 1 was discontinued in GCC 3.2.  Support for
FreeBSD 2 (and any mutant a.out variants of FreeBSD 3) was
discontinued in GCC 4.0.
</p>
<p>In order to better utilize FreeBSD base system functionality and match
the configuration of the system compiler, GCC 4.5 and above as well as
GCC 4.4 past 2010-06-20 leverage SSP support in libc (which is present
on FreeBSD 7 or later) and the use of <code>__cxa_atexit</code> by default
(on FreeBSD 6 or later).  The use of <code>dl_iterate_phdr</code> inside
<samp>libgcc_s.so.1</samp> and boehm-gc (on FreeBSD 7 or later) is enabled
by GCC 4.5 and above.
</p>
<p>We support FreeBSD using the ELF file format with DWARF 2 debugging
for all CPU architectures.  You may use <samp>-gstabs</samp> instead of
<samp>-g</samp>, if you really want the old debugging format.  There are
no known issues with mixing object files and libraries with different
debugging formats.  Otherwise, this release of GCC should now match
more of the configuration used in the stock FreeBSD configuration of
GCC.  In particular, <samp>--enable-threads</samp> is now configured by
default.  However, as a general user, do not attempt to replace the
system compiler with this release.  Known to bootstrap and check with
good results on FreeBSD 7.2-STABLE.  In the past, known to bootstrap
and check with good results on FreeBSD 3.0, 3.4, 4.0, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4,
4.5, 4.8, 4.9 and 5-CURRENT.
</p>
<p>The version of binutils installed in <samp>/usr/bin</samp> probably works
with this release of GCC.  Bootstrapping against the latest GNU
binutils and/or the version found in <samp>/usr/ports/devel/binutils</samp> has
been known to enable additional features and improve overall testsuite
results.  However, it is currently known that boehm-gc may not configure
properly on FreeBSD prior to the FreeBSD 7.0 release with GNU binutils
after 2.16.1.

<h3 class="heading">hppa*-hp-hpux*</h3>
<p>Support for HP-UX version 9 and older was discontinued in GCC 3.4.
</p>
<p>We require using gas/binutils on all hppa platforms.  Version 2.19 or
later is recommended.
</p>
<p>It may be helpful to configure GCC with the
<a href="./configure.html#with-gnu-as"><samp>--with-gnu-as</samp></a> and
<samp>--with-as=&hellip;</samp> options to ensure that GCC can find GAS.
</p>
<p>The HP assembler should not be used with GCC.  It is rarely tested and may
not work.  It shouldn&rsquo;t be used with any languages other than C due to its
many limitations.
</p>
<p>Specifically, <samp>-g</samp> does not work (HP-UX uses a peculiar debugging
format which GCC does not know about).  It also inserts timestamps
into each object file it creates, causing the 3-stage comparison test to
fail during a bootstrap.  You should be able to continue by saying
&lsquo;<samp>make all-host all-target</samp>&rsquo; after getting the failure from &lsquo;<samp>make</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Various GCC features are not supported.  For example, it does not support weak
symbols or alias definitions.  As a result, explicit template instantiations
are required when using C++.  This makes it difficult if not impossible to
build many C++ applications.
</p>
<p>There are two default scheduling models for instructions.  These are
PROCESSOR_7100LC and PROCESSOR_8000.  They are selected from the pa-risc
architecture specified for the target machine when configuring.
PROCESSOR_8000 is the default.  PROCESSOR_7100LC is selected when
the target is a &lsquo;<samp>hppa1*</samp>&rsquo; machine.
</p>
<p>The PROCESSOR_8000 model is not well suited to older processors.  Thus,
it is important to completely specify the machine architecture when
configuring if you want a model other than PROCESSOR_8000.  The macro
TARGET_SCHED_DEFAULT can be defined in BOOT_CFLAGS if a different
default scheduling model is desired.
</p>
<p>As of GCC 4.0, GCC uses the UNIX 95 namespace for HP-UX 10.10
through 11.00, and the UNIX 98 namespace for HP-UX 11.11 and later.
This namespace change might cause problems when bootstrapping with
an earlier version of GCC or the HP compiler as essentially the same
namespace is required for an entire build.  This problem can be avoided
in a number of ways.  With HP cc, <code>UNIX_STD</code> can be set to &lsquo;<samp>95</samp>&rsquo;
or &lsquo;<samp>98</samp>&rsquo;.  Another way is to add an appropriate set of predefines
to <code>CC</code>.  The description for the <samp>munix=</samp> option contains
a list of the predefines used with each standard.
</p>
<p>More specific information to &lsquo;<samp>hppa*-hp-hpux*</samp>&rsquo; targets follows.

<p>For hpux10.20, we <em>highly</em> recommend you pick up the latest sed patch

<p>The C++ ABI has changed incompatibly in GCC 4.0.  COMDAT subspaces are
used for one-only code and data.  This resolves many of the previous
problems in using C++ on this target.  However, the ABI is not compatible
with the one implemented under HP-UX 11 using secondary definitions.

<p>GCC 3.0 and up support HP-UX 11.  GCC 2.95.x is not supported and cannot
be used to compile GCC 3.0 and up.
</p>
<p>The libffi library haven&rsquo;t been ported to 64-bit HP-UX&nbsp;and doesn&rsquo;t build.
</p>
<p>Refer to <a href="binaries.html">binaries</a> for information about obtaining
precompiled GCC binaries for HP-UX.  Precompiled binaries must be obtained
to build the Ada language as it cannot be bootstrapped using C.  Ada is
only available for the 32-bit PA-RISC runtime.
</p>
<p>Starting with GCC 3.4 an ISO C compiler is required to bootstrap.  The
bundled compiler supports only traditional C; you will need either HP&rsquo;s
unbundled compiler, or a binary distribution of GCC.
</p>
<p>It is possible to build GCC 3.3 starting with the bundled HP compiler,
but the process requires several steps.  GCC 3.3 can then be used to
build later versions.
</p>
<p>There are several possible approaches to building the distribution.
Binutils can be built first using the HP tools.  Then, the GCC
distribution can be built.  The second approach is to build GCC
first using the HP tools, then build binutils, then rebuild GCC.
There have been problems with various binary distributions, so it
is best not to start from a binary distribution.
</p>
<p>On 64-bit capable systems, there are two distinct targets.  Different
installation prefixes must be used if both are to be installed on
the same system.  The &lsquo;<samp>hppa[1-2]*-hp-hpux11*</samp>&rsquo; target generates code
for the 32-bit PA-RISC runtime architecture and uses the HP linker.
The &lsquo;<samp>hppa64-hp-hpux11*</samp>&rsquo; target generates 64-bit code for the
PA-RISC 2.0 architecture.
</p>
<p>The script config.guess now selects the target type based on the compiler
detected during configuration.  You must define <code>PATH</code> or <code>CC</code> so
that configure finds an appropriate compiler for the initial bootstrap.
When <code>CC</code> is used, the definition should contain the options that are
needed whenever <code>CC</code> is used.
</p>
<p>Specifically, options that determine the runtime architecture must be
in <code>CC</code> to correctly select the target for the build.  It is also
convenient to place many other compiler options in <code>CC</code>.  For example,
<code>CC=&quot;cc -Ac +DA2.0W -Wp,-H16376 -D_CLASSIC_TYPES -D_HPUX_SOURCE&quot;</code>
can be used to bootstrap the GCC 3.3 branch with the HP compiler in
64-bit K&amp;R/bundled mode.  The <samp>+DA2.0W</samp> option will result in
the automatic selection of the &lsquo;<samp>hppa64-hp-hpux11*</samp>&rsquo; target.  The
macro definition table of cpp needs to be increased for a successful
build with the HP compiler.  _CLASSIC_TYPES and _HPUX_SOURCE need to
be defined when building with the bundled compiler, or when using the
<samp>-Ac</samp> option.  These defines aren&rsquo;t necessary with <samp>-Ae</samp>.
</p>
<p>It is best to explicitly configure the &lsquo;<samp>hppa64-hp-hpux11*</samp>&rsquo; target
with the <samp>--with-ld=&hellip;</samp> option.  This overrides the standard
search for ld.  The two linkers supported on this target require different
commands.  The default linker is determined during configuration.  As a
result, it&rsquo;s not possible to switch linkers in the middle of a GCC build.
This has been reported to sometimes occur in unified builds of binutils
and GCC.
</p>
<p>A recent linker patch must be installed for the correct operation of
GCC 3.3 and later.  <code>PHSS_26559</code> and <code>PHSS_24304</code> are the
oldest linker patches that are known to work.  They are for HP-UX
11.00 and 11.11, respectively.  <code>PHSS_24303</code>, the companion to
<code>PHSS_24304</code>, might be usable but it hasn&rsquo;t been tested.  These
patches have been superseded.  Consult the HP patch database to obtain
the currently recommended linker patch for your system.
</p>
<p>The patches are necessary for the support of weak symbols on the
32-bit port, and for the running of initializers and finalizers.  Weak
symbols are implemented using SOM secondary definition symbols.  Prior
to HP-UX 11, there are bugs in the linker support for secondary symbols.
The patches correct a problem of linker core dumps creating shared
libraries containing secondary symbols, as well as various other
linking issues involving secondary symbols.
</p>
<p>GCC 3.3 uses the ELF DT_INIT_ARRAY and DT_FINI_ARRAY capabilities to
run initializers and finalizers on the 64-bit port.  The 32-bit port
uses the linker <samp>+init</samp> and <samp>+fini</samp> options for the same
purpose.  The patches correct various problems with the +init/+fini
options, including program core dumps.  Binutils 2.14 corrects a
problem on the 64-bit port resulting from HP&rsquo;s non-standard use of
the .init and .fini sections for array initializers and finalizers.
</p>
<p>Although the HP and GNU linkers are both supported for the
&lsquo;<samp>hppa64-hp-hpux11*</samp>&rsquo; target, it is strongly recommended that the
HP linker be used for link editing on this target.
</p>
<p>At this time, the GNU linker does not support the creation of long
branch stubs.  As a result, it cannot successfully link binaries
containing branch offsets larger than 8 megabytes.  In addition,
there are problems linking shared libraries, linking executables
with <samp>-static</samp>, and with dwarf2 unwind and exception support.
It also doesn&rsquo;t provide stubs for internal calls to global functions
in shared libraries, so these calls cannot be overloaded.
</p>
<p>The HP dynamic loader does not support GNU symbol versioning, so symbol
versioning is not supported.  It may be necessary to disable symbol
versioning with <samp>--disable-symvers</samp> when using GNU ld.
</p>
<p>POSIX threads are the default.  The optional DCE thread library is not
supported, so <samp>--enable-threads=dce</samp> does not work.

<p>Use this for Solaris 10 or later on x86 and x86-64 systems.  Starting
with GCC 4.7, there is also a 64-bit &lsquo;<samp>amd64-*-solaris2.1[0-9]*</samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp>x86_64-*-solaris2.1[0-9]*</samp>&rsquo; configuration that corresponds to
&lsquo;<samp>sparcv9-sun-solaris2*</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>It is recommended that you configure GCC to use the GNU assembler.  The
versions included in Solaris 10, from GNU binutils 2.15 (in
<samp>/usr/sfw/bin/gas</samp>), and Solaris 11, from GNU binutils 2.19 or
newer (also available as <samp>/usr/bin/gas</samp> and
<samp>/usr/gnu/bin/as</samp>), work fine.  The current version, from GNU
binutils 2.29, is known to work, but the version from GNU binutils 2.26
must be avoided.  Recent versions of the Solaris assembler in
<samp>/usr/ccs/bin/as</samp> work almost as well, though.
</p>
<p>For linking, the Solaris linker, is preferred.  If you want to use the GNU
linker instead, note that due to a packaging bug the version in Solaris
10, from GNU binutils 2.15 (in <samp>/usr/sfw/bin/gld</samp>), cannot be used,
while the version in Solaris 11, from GNU binutils 2.19 or newer (also
in <samp>/usr/gnu/bin/ld</samp> and <samp>/usr/bin/gld</samp>), works, as does the
latest version, from GNU binutils 2.29.
</p>
<p>To use GNU <code>as</code>, configure with the options
<samp>--with-gnu-as --with-as=/usr/sfw/bin/gas</samp>.  It may be necessary
to configure with <samp>--without-gnu-ld --with-ld=/usr/ccs/bin/ld</samp> to

<p>None of the following versions of GCC has an ABI that is compatible

Red Hat 2.96 and Trillian 000171 are compatible with each other:
3.1, 3.0.2, 3.0.1, 3.0, Red Hat 2.96, and Trillian 000717.
This primarily affects C++ programs and programs that create shared libraries.
GCC 3.1 or later is recommended for compiling linux, the kernel.
As of version 3.1 GCC is believed to be fully ABI compliant, and hence no
more major ABI changes are expected.

<p>&ldquo;out of memory&rdquo; bootstrap failures may indicate a problem with
process resource limits (ulimit).  Hard limits are configured in the
<samp>/etc/security/limits</samp> system configuration file.
</p>
<p>GCC 4.9 and above require a C++ compiler for bootstrap.  IBM VAC++ / xlC
cannot bootstrap GCC.  xlc can bootstrap an older version of GCC and
G++ can bootstrap recent releases of GCC.
</p>
<p>GCC can bootstrap with recent versions of IBM XLC, but bootstrapping
with an earlier release of GCC is recommended.  Bootstrapping with XLC
requires a larger data segment, which can be enabled through the
<var>LDR_CNTRL</var> environment variable, e.g.,
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">% LDR_CNTRL=MAXDATA=0x50000000
% export LDR_CNTRL
</pre></div>

<p>One can start with a pre-compiled version of GCC to build from
sources.  One may delete GCC&rsquo;s &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; header files when starting
with a version of GCC built for an earlier release of AIX.
</p>
<p>To speed up the configuration phases of bootstrapping and installing GCC,
one may use GNU Bash instead of AIX <code>/bin/sh</code>, e.g.,
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">% CONFIG_SHELL=/opt/freeware/bin/bash
% export CONFIG_SHELL
</pre></div>

<p>and then proceed as described in <a href="build.html">the build
instructions</a>, where we strongly recommend specifying an absolute path
to invoke <var>srcdir</var>/configure.
</p>
<p>Because GCC on AIX is built as a 32-bit executable by default,
(although it can generate 64-bit programs) the GMP and MPFR libraries
required by gfortran must be 32-bit libraries.  Building GMP and MPFR
as static archive libraries works better than shared libraries.
</p>
<p>Errors involving <code>alloca</code> when building GCC generally are due
to an incorrect definition of <code>CC</code> in the Makefile or mixing files
compiled with the native C compiler and GCC.  During the stage1 phase of
the build, the native AIX compiler <strong>must</strong> be invoked as <code>cc</code>
(not <code>xlc</code>).  Once <code>configure</code> has been informed of
<code>xlc</code>, one needs to use &lsquo;<samp>make distclean</samp>&rsquo; to remove the
configure cache files and ensure that <code>CC</code> environment variable
does not provide a definition that will confuse <code>configure</code>.
If this error occurs during stage2 or later, then the problem most likely
is the version of Make (see above).
</p>
<p>The native <code>as</code> and <code>ld</code> are recommended for
bootstrapping on AIX.  The GNU Assembler, GNU Linker, and GNU
Binutils version 2.20 is the minimum level that supports bootstrap on
AIX 5.  The GNU Assembler has not been updated to support AIX 6&nbsp;or
AIX 7.  The native AIX tools do interoperate with GCC.
</p>
<p>AIX 7.1 added partial support for DWARF debugging, but full support
requires AIX 7.1 TL03 SP7 that supports additional DWARF sections and
fixes a bug in the assembler.  AIX 7.1 TL03 SP5 distributed a version
of libm.a missing important symbols; a fix for IV77796 will be
included in SP6.
</p>
<p>AIX 5.3 TL10, AIX 6.1 TL05 and AIX 7.1 TL00 introduced an AIX
assembler change that sometimes produces corrupt assembly files
causing AIX linker errors.  The bug breaks GCC bootstrap on AIX and
can cause compilation failures with existing GCC installations.  An
AIX iFix for AIX 5.3 is available (APAR IZ98385 for AIX 5.3 TL10, APAR
IZ98477 for AIX 5.3 TL11 and IZ98134 for AIX 5.3 TL12). AIX 5.3 TL11 SP8,
AIX 5.3 TL12 SP5, AIX 6.1 TL04 SP11, AIX 6.1 TL05 SP7, AIX 6.1 TL06 SP6,
AIX 6.1 TL07 and AIX 7.1 TL01 should include the fix.

<p>Building <samp>libstdc++.a</samp> requires a fix for an AIX Assembler bug

<p>Linking executables and shared libraries may produce warnings of
duplicate symbols.  The assembly files generated by GCC for AIX always

executable.

<p>AIX 4.3 utilizes a &ldquo;large format&rdquo; archive to support both 32-bit and
64-bit object modules.  The routines provided in AIX 4.3.0 and AIX 4.3.1
to parse archive libraries did not handle the new format correctly.
These routines are used by GCC and result in error messages during
linking such as &ldquo;not a COFF file&rdquo;.  The version of the routines shipped
with AIX 4.3.1 should work for a 32-bit environment.  The <samp>-g</samp>
option of the archive command may be used to create archives of 32-bit
objects using the original &ldquo;small format&rdquo;.  A correct version of the
routines is shipped with AIX 4.3.2 and above.

<p>AIX provides National Language Support (NLS).  Compilers and assemblers
use NLS to support locale-specific representations of various data
formats including floating-point numbers (e.g., &lsquo;<samp>.</samp>&rsquo;  vs &lsquo;<samp>,</samp>&rsquo; for
separating decimal fractions).  There have been problems reported where
GCC does not produce the same floating-point formats that the assembler

<p>If on a MIPS system you get an error message saying &ldquo;does not have gp
sections for all it&rsquo;s [sic] sectons [sic]&rdquo;, don&rsquo;t worry about it.  This
happens whenever you use GAS with the MIPS linker, but there is not
really anything wrong, and it is okay to use the output file.  You can
stop such warnings by installing the GNU linker.
</p>
<p>It would be nice to extend GAS to produce the gp tables, but they are
optional, and there should not be a warning about their absence.
</p>
<p>The libstdc++ atomic locking routines for MIPS targets requires MIPS II
and later.  A patch went in just after the GCC 3.3 release to
make &lsquo;<samp>mips*-*-*</samp>&rsquo; use the generic implementation instead.  You can also
configure for &lsquo;<samp>mipsel-elf</samp>&rsquo; as a workaround.  The
&lsquo;<samp>mips*-*-linux*</samp>&rsquo; target continues to use the MIPS II routines.  More
work on this is expected in future releases.
</p>

<p>The built-in <code>__sync_*</code> functions are available on MIPS II and
later systems and others that support the &lsquo;<samp>ll</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>sc</samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp>sync</samp>&rsquo; instructions.  This can be overridden by passing
<samp>--with-llsc</samp> or <samp>--without-llsc</samp> when configuring GCC.
Since the Linux kernel emulates these instructions if they are
missing, the default for &lsquo;<samp>mips*-*-linux*</samp>&rsquo; targets is
<samp>--with-llsc</samp>.  The <samp>--with-llsc</samp> and
<samp>--without-llsc</samp> configure options may be overridden at compile
time by passing the <samp>-mllsc</samp> or <samp>-mno-llsc</samp> options to
the compiler.
</p>
<p>MIPS systems check for division by zero (unless
<samp>-mno-check-zero-division</samp> is passed to the compiler) by
generating either a conditional trap or a break instruction.  Using
trap results in smaller code, but is only supported on MIPS II and
later.  Also, some versions of the Linux kernel have a bug that
prevents trap from generating the proper signal (<code>SIGFPE</code>).  To enable
the use of break, use the <samp>--with-divide=breaks</samp>
<code>configure</code> option when configuring GCC.  The default is to

<p>Support for Solaris 10 has been obsoleted in GCC 9, but can still be
enabled by configuring with <samp>--enable-obsolete</samp>.  Support will be
removed in GCC 10.  Support for Solaris 9 has been removed in GCC 5.
Support for Solaris 8 has been removed in GCC 4.8.  Support for Solaris
7 has been removed in GCC 4.6.
</p>
<p>Sun does not ship a C compiler with Solaris 2 before Solaris 10, though
you can download the Sun Studio compilers for free.  In Solaris 10 and
11, GCC 3.4.3 is available as <code>/usr/sfw/bin/gcc</code>.  Solaris 11
also provides GCC 4.5.2, 4.7.3, and 4.8.2 as
<code>/usr/gcc/4.5/bin/gcc</code> or similar.  Alternatively,
you can install a pre-built GCC to bootstrap and install GCC.  See the
<a href="binaries.html">binaries page</a> for details.
</p>
<p>The Solaris 2 <code>/bin/sh</code> will often fail to configure
&lsquo;<samp>libstdc++-v3</samp>&rsquo;or &lsquo;<samp>boehm-gc</samp>&rsquo;.  We therefore recommend using the
following initial sequence of commands
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">% CONFIG_SHELL=/bin/ksh
% export CONFIG_SHELL
</pre></div>

<p>and proceed as described in <a href="configure.html">the configure instructions</a>.
In addition we strongly recommend specifying an absolute path to invoke
<code><var>srcdir</var>/configure</code>.
</p>
<p>Solaris 10 comes with a number of optional OS packages.  Some of these
are needed to use GCC fully, namely <code>SUNWarc</code>,
<code>SUNWbtool</code>, <code>SUNWesu</code>, <code>SUNWhea</code>, <code>SUNWlibm</code>,
<code>SUNWsprot</code>, and <code>SUNWtoo</code>.  If you did not install all
optional packages when installing Solaris 10, you will need to verify that
the packages that GCC needs are installed.
To check whether an optional package is installed, use
the <code>pkginfo</code> command.  To add an optional package, use the
<code>pkgadd</code> command.  For further details, see the Solaris 10
documentation.
</p>
<p>Starting with Solaris 11, the package management has changed, so you
need to check for <code>system/header</code>, <code>system/linker</code>, and
<code>developer/assembler</code> packages.  Checking for and installing
packages is done with the <code>pkg</code> command now.
</p>
<p>Trying to use the linker and other tools in
<samp>/usr/ucb</samp> to install GCC has been observed to cause trouble.
For example, the linker may hang indefinitely.  The fix is to remove
<samp>/usr/ucb</samp> from your <code>PATH</code>.
</p>
<p>The build process works more smoothly with the legacy Sun tools so, if you
have <samp>/usr/xpg4/bin</samp> in your <code>PATH</code>, we recommend that you place
<samp>/usr/bin</samp> before <samp>/usr/xpg4/bin</samp> for the duration of the build.
</p>
<p>We recommend the use of the Solaris assembler or the GNU assembler, in
conjunction with the Solaris linker.  The GNU <code>as</code>
versions included in Solaris 10, from GNU binutils 2.15 (in
<samp>/usr/sfw/bin/gas</samp>), and Solaris 11,
from GNU binutils 2.19 or newer (also in <samp>/usr/bin/gas</samp> and
<samp>/usr/gnu/bin/as</samp>), are known to work.
The current version, from GNU binutils 2.29,
is known to work as well.  Note that your mileage may vary
if you use a combination of the GNU tools and the Solaris tools: while the
combination GNU <code>as</code> + Sun <code>ld</code> should reasonably work,
the reverse combination Sun <code>as</code> + GNU <code>ld</code> may fail to
build or cause memory corruption at runtime in some cases for C++ programs.
GNU <code>ld</code> usually works as well, although the version included in
Solaris 10 cannot be used due to several bugs.  Again, the current
version (2.29) is known to work, but generally lacks platform specific
features, so better stay with Solaris <code>ld</code>.  To use the LTO linker
plugin (<samp>-fuse-linker-plugin</samp>) with GNU <code>ld</code>, GNU
binutils <em>must</em> be configured with <samp>--enable-largefile</samp>.
</p>
<p>To enable symbol versioning in &lsquo;<samp>libstdc++</samp>&rsquo; with the Solaris linker,
you need to have any version of GNU <code>c++filt</code>, which is part of
GNU binutils.  &lsquo;<samp>libstdc++</samp>&rsquo; symbol versioning will be disabled if no
appropriate version is found.  Solaris <code>c++filt</code> from the Solaris
Studio compilers does <em>not</em> work.
</p>
<p>Sun bug 4927647 sometimes causes random spurious testsuite failures
related to missing diagnostic output.  This bug doesn&rsquo;t affect GCC
itself, rather it is a kernel bug triggered by the <code>expect</code>
program which is used only by the GCC testsuite driver.  When the bug
causes the <code>expect</code> program to miss anticipated output, extra
testsuite failures appear.

<p>When GCC is configured to use GNU binutils 2.14 or later, the binaries
produced are smaller than the ones produced using Sun&rsquo;s native tools;
this difference is quite significant for binaries containing debugging
information.
</p>
<p>Starting with Solaris 7, the operating system is capable of executing
64-bit SPARC V9 binaries.  GCC 3.1 and later properly supports
this; the <samp>-m64</samp> option enables 64-bit code generation.
However, if all you want is code tuned for the UltraSPARC CPU, you
should try the <samp>-mtune=ultrasparc</samp> option instead, which produces
code that, unlike full 64-bit code, can still run on non-UltraSPARC
machines.
</p>
<p>When configuring the GNU Multiple Precision Library (GMP), the MPFR
library or the MPC library on a Solaris 7 or later system, the canonical
target triplet must be specified as the <code>build</code> parameter on the
configure line.  This target triplet can be obtained by invoking <code>./config.guess</code> in the toplevel source directory of GCC (and
not that of GMP or MPFR or MPC).  For example on a Solaris 9 system:
</p>
<div class="smallexample">
<pre class="smallexample">% ./configure --build=sparc-sun-solaris2.9 --prefix=xxx
</pre></div>

We welcome patches for other architectures supported by VxWorks 5.5.
Support for VxWorks AE would also be welcome; we believe this is merely
a matter of writing an appropriate &ldquo;configlette&rdquo; (see below).  We are
not interested in supporting older, a.out or COFF-based, versions of
VxWorks in GCC 3.
</p>
<p>VxWorks comes with an older version of GCC installed in
<samp><var>$WIND_BASE</var>/host</samp>; we recommend you do not overwrite it.
Choose an installation <var>prefix</var> entirely outside <var>$WIND_BASE</var>.
Before running <code>configure</code>, create the directories <samp><var>prefix</var></samp>
and <samp><var>prefix</var>/bin</samp>.  Link or copy the appropriate assembler,
linker, etc. into <samp><var>prefix</var>/bin</samp>, and set your <var>PATH</var> to
include that directory while running both <code>configure</code> and
<code>make</code>.
</p>
<p>You must give <code>configure</code> the
<samp>--with-headers=<var>$WIND_BASE</var>/target/h</samp> switch so that it can
find the VxWorks system headers.  Since VxWorks is a cross compilation
target only, you must also specify <samp>--target=<var>target</var></samp>.
<code>configure</code> will attempt to create the directory
<samp><var>prefix</var>/<var>target</var>/sys-include</samp> and copy files into it;
make sure the user running <code>configure</code> has sufficient privilege
to do so.
</p>
<p>GCC&rsquo;s exception handling runtime requires a special &ldquo;configlette&rdquo;
module, <samp>contrib/gthr_supp_vxw_5x.c</samp>.  Follow the instructions in
that file to add the module to your kernel build.  (Future versions of
VxWorks will incorporate this module.)

<p>GCC will build with and support only MinGW runtime 3.12 and later.
Earlier versions of headers are incompatible with the new default semantics
of <code>extern inline</code> in <code>-std=c99</code> and <code>-std=gnu99</code> modes.

<h3 class="heading">Older systems</h3>
<p>GCC contains support files for many older (1980s and early
1990s) Unix variants.  For the most part, support for these systems
has not been deliberately removed, but it has not been maintained for
several years and may suffer from bitrot.
</p>
<p>Starting with GCC 3.1, each release has a list of &ldquo;obsoleted&rdquo; systems.
Support for these systems is still present in that release, but
<code>configure</code> will fail unless the <samp>--enable-obsolete</samp>
option is given.  Unless a maintainer steps forward, support for these
systems will be removed from the next release of GCC.
</p>
<p>Support for old systems as hosts for GCC can cause problems if the
workarounds for compiler, library and operating system bugs affect the
cleanliness or maintainability of the rest of GCC.  In some cases, to
bring GCC up on such a system, if still possible with current GCC, may
require first installing an old version of GCC which did work on that
system, and using it to compile a more recent GCC, to avoid bugs in the
vendor compiler.  Old releases of GCC 1 and GCC 2 are available in the
<samp>old-releases</samp> directory on the <a href="../mirrors.html">GCC mirror
sites</a>.  Header bugs may generally be avoided using
<code>fixincludes</code>, but bugs or deficiencies in libraries and the
operating system may still cause problems.
</p>
<p>Support for older systems as targets for cross-compilation is less
problematic than support for them as hosts for GCC; if an enthusiast
wishes to make such a target work again (including resurrecting any of
the targets that never worked with GCC 2, starting from the last
version before they were removed), patches
<a href="../contribute.html">following the usual requirements</a> would be
likely to be accepted, since they should not affect the support for more
modern targets.
</p>
<p>For some systems, old versions of GNU binutils may also be useful,
and are available from <samp>pub/binutils/old-releases</samp> on
<a href="https://sourceware.org/mirrors.html">sourceware.org mirror sites</a>.
</p>
<p>Some of the information on specific systems above relates to
such older systems, but much of the information
about GCC on such systems (which may no longer be applicable to
current GCC) is to be found in the GCC texinfo manual.

<h3 class="heading">all ELF targets (SVR4, Solaris 2, etc.)</h3>
<p>C++ support is significantly better on ELF targets if you use the
<a href="./configure.html#with-gnu-ld">GNU linker</a>; duplicate copies of
inlines, vtables and template instantiations will be discarded
automatically.
