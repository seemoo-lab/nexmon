/* This header generic type query and conversion functions.


USING THE GENERIC TYPE FACILITY


The user functions are:

bool is_a <TYPE> (pointer)

    Tests whether the pointer actually points to a more derived TYPE.

    Suppose you have a symtab_node *ptr, AKA symtab_node *ptr.  You can test
    whether it points to a 'derived' cgraph_node as follows.

      if (is_a <cgraph_node *> (ptr))
        ....


TYPE as_a <TYPE> (pointer)

    Converts pointer to a TYPE.

    You can just assume that it is such a node.

      do_something_with (as_a <cgraph_node *> *ptr);

TYPE safe_as_a <TYPE> (pointer)

    Like as_a <TYPE> (pointer), but where pointer could be NULL.  This
    adds a check against NULL where the regular is_a_helper hook for TYPE
    assumes non-NULL.

      do_something_with (safe_as_a <cgraph_node *> *ptr);

TYPE dyn_cast <TYPE> (pointer)

    Converts pointer to TYPE if and only if "is_a <TYPE> pointer".  Otherwise,
    returns NULL.  This function is essentially a checked down cast.

    This functions reduce compile time and increase type safety when treating a
    generic item as a more specific item.

    You can test and obtain a pointer to the 'derived' type in one indivisible
    operation.

      if (cgraph_node *cptr = dyn_cast <cgraph_node *> (ptr))
        ....

    As an example, the code change is from

      if (symtab_function_p (node))
        {
          struct cgraph_node *cnode = cgraph (node);
          ....
        }

    to

      if (cgraph_node *cnode = dyn_cast <cgraph_node *> (node))
        {
          ....
        }

    The necessary conditional test defines a variable that holds a known good
    pointer to the specific item and avoids subsequent conversion calls and
    the assertion checks that may come with them.

    When, the property test is embedded within a larger condition, the
    variable declaration gets pulled out of the condition.  (This approach
    leaves some room for using the variable inappropriately.)

      if (symtab_variable_p (node) && varpool (node)->finalized)
        varpool_analyze_node (varpool (node));

    becomes

      varpool_node *vnode = dyn_cast <varpool_node *> (node);
      if (vnode && vnode->finalized)
        varpool_analyze_node (vnode);

    Note that we have converted two sets of assertions in the calls to varpool
    into safe and efficient use of a variable.


If you use these functions and get a 'inline function not defined' or a
'missing symbol' error message for 'is_a_helper<....>::test', it means that
the connection between the types has not been made.  See below.


EXTENDING THE GENERIC TYPE FACILITY

Each connection between types must be made by defining a specialization of the
template member function 'test' of the template class 'is_a_helper'.  For
example,

  template <>
  template <>
  inline bool
  is_a_helper <cgraph_node *>::test (symtab_node *p)
  {
    return p->type == SYMTAB_FUNCTION;
  }

If a simple reinterpret_cast between the pointer types is incorrect, then you
must also specialize the template member function 'cast'.  Failure to do so
when needed may result in a crash.  For example,

  template <>
  template <>
  inline bool
  is_a_helper <cgraph_node *>::cast (symtab_node *p)
  {
    return &p->x_function;
  }
