/* A major contribution to object and executable size is debug
   information size.  A major contribution to debug information size
   is struct descriptions replicated in several object files. The
   following flags attempt to reduce this information.  The basic
   idea is to not emit struct debugging information in the current
   compilation unit when that information will be generated by
   another compilation unit.

   Debug information for a struct defined in the current source
   file should be generated in the object file.  Likewise the
   debug information for a struct defined in a header should be
   generated in the object file of the corresponding source file.
   Both of these case are handled when the base name of the file of
   the struct definition matches the base name of the source file
   of the current compilation unit.  This matching emits minimal
   struct debugging information.

   The base file name matching rule above will fail to emit debug
   information for structs defined in system headers.  So a second
   category of files includes system headers in addition to files
   with matching bases.

   The remaining types of files are library headers and application
   headers.  We cannot currently distinguish these two types.  */
