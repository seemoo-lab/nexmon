.SH "NAME"
ld \- The GNU linker
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
ld [\fBoptions\fR] \fIobjfile\fR ...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBld\fR combines a number of object and archive files, relocates
their data and ties up symbol references. Usually the last step in
compiling a program is to run \fBld\fR.
.PP
\&\fBld\fR accepts Linker Command Language files written in
a superset of \s-1AT&T\s0's Link Editor Command Language syntax,
to provide explicit and total control over the linking process.
.PP
This man page does not describe the command language; see the
\&\fBld\fR entry in \f(CW\*(C`info\*(C'\fR for full details on the command
language and on other aspects of the \s-1GNU\s0 linker.
.PP
This version of \fBld\fR uses the general purpose \s-1BFD\s0 libraries
to operate on object files. This allows \fBld\fR to read, combine, and
write object files in many different formats\-\-\-for example, \s-1COFF\s0 or
\&\f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR.  Different formats may be linked together to produce any
available kind of object file.
.PP
Aside from its flexibility, the \s-1GNU\s0 linker is more helpful than other
linkers in providing diagnostic information.  Many linkers abandon
execution immediately upon encountering an error; whenever possible,
\&\fBld\fR continues executing, allowing you to identify other errors
(or, in some cases, to get an output file in spite of the error).
.PP
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker \fBld\fR is meant to cover a broad range of situations,
and to be as compatible as possible with other linkers.  As a result,
you have many choices to control its behavior.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The linker supports a plethora of command-line options, but in actual
practice few of them are used in any particular context.
For instance, a frequent use of \fBld\fR is to link standard Unix
object files on a standard, supported Unix system.  On such a system, to
link a file \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        ld \-o <output> /lib/crt0.o hello.o \-lc
.Ve
.PP
This tells \fBld\fR to produce a file called \fIoutput\fR as the
result of linking the file \f(CW\*(C`/lib/crt0.o\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`hello.o\*(C'\fR and
the library \f(CW\*(C`libc.a\*(C'\fR, which will come from the standard search
directories.  (See the discussion of the \fB\-l\fR option below.)
.PP
Some of the command-line options to \fBld\fR may be specified at any
point in the command line.  However, options which refer to files, such
as \fB\-l\fR or \fB\-T\fR, cause the file to be read at the point at
which the option appears in the command line, relative to the object
files and other file options.  Repeating non-file options with a
different argument will either have no further effect, or override prior
occurrences (those further to the left on the command line) of that
option.  Options which may be meaningfully specified more than once are
noted in the descriptions below.
.PP
Non-option arguments are object files or archives which are to be linked
together.  They may follow, precede, or be mixed in with command-line
options, except that an object file argument may not be placed between
an option and its argument.
.PP
Usually the linker is invoked with at least one object file, but you can
specify other forms of binary input files using \fB\-l\fR, \fB\-R\fR,
and the script command language.  If \fIno\fR binary input files at all
are specified, the linker does not produce any output, and issues the
message \fBNo input files\fR.
.PP
If the linker cannot recognize the format of an object file, it will
assume that it is a linker script.  A script specified in this way
augments the main linker script used for the link (either the default
linker script or the one specified by using \fB\-T\fR).  This feature
permits the linker to link against a file which appears to be an object
or an archive, but actually merely defines some symbol values, or uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`INPUT\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`GROUP\*(C'\fR to load other objects.  Specifying a
script in this way merely augments the main linker script, with the
extra commands placed after the main script; use the \fB\-T\fR option
to replace the default linker script entirely, but note the effect of
the \f(CW\*(C`INSERT\*(C'\fR command.
.PP
For options whose names are a single letter,
option arguments must either follow the option letter without intervening
whitespace, or be given as separate arguments immediately following the
option that requires them.
.PP
For options whose names are multiple letters, either one dash or two can
precede the option name; for example, \fB\-trace\-symbol\fR and
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol\fR are equivalent.  Note\-\-\-there is one exception to
this rule.  Multiple letter options that start with a lower case 'o' can
only be preceded by two dashes.  This is to reduce confusion with the
\&\fB\-o\fR option.  So for example \fB\-omagic\fR sets the output file
name to \fBmagic\fR whereas \fB\-\-omagic\fR sets the \s-1NMAGIC\s0 flag on the
output.
.PP
Arguments to multiple-letter options must either be separated from the
option name by an equals sign, or be given as separate arguments
immediately following the option that requires them.  For example,
\&\fB\-\-trace\-symbol foo\fR and \fB\-\-trace\-symbol=foo\fR are equivalent.
Unique abbreviations of the names of multiple-letter options are
accepted.
.PP
Note\-\-\-if the linker is being invoked indirectly, via a compiler driver
(e.g. \fBgcc\fR) then all the linker command line options should be
prefixed by \fB\-Wl,\fR (or whatever is appropriate for the particular
compiler driver) like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&          gcc \-Wl,\-\-start\-group foo.o bar.o \-Wl,\-\-end\-group
.Ve
.PP
This is important, because otherwise the compiler driver program may
silently drop the linker options, resulting in a bad link.  Confusion
may also arise when passing options that require values through a
driver, as the use of a space between option and argument acts as
a separator, and causes the driver to pass only the option to the linker
and the argument to the compiler.  In this case, it is simplest to use
the joined forms of both single\- and multiple-letter options, such as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&          gcc foo.o bar.o \-Wl,\-eENTRY \-Wl,\-Map=a.map
.Ve
.PP
Here is a table of the generic command line switches accepted by the \s-1GNU\s0
linker:
.IP "\fB@\fR\fIfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "@file"
Read command-line options from \fIfile\fR.  The options read are
inserted in place of the original @\fIfile\fR option.  If \fIfile\fR
does not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
literally, and not removed.
.Sp
Options in \fIfile\fR are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
character may be included in an option by surrounding the entire
option in either single or double quotes.  Any character (including a
backslash) may be included by prefixing the character to be included
with a backslash.  The \fIfile\fR may itself contain additional
@\fIfile\fR options; any such options will be processed recursively.
.IP "\fB\-a\fR \fIkeyword\fR" 4
.IX Item "-a keyword"
This option is supported for \s-1HP/UX\s0 compatibility.  The \fIkeyword\fR
argument must be one of the strings \fBarchive\fR, \fBshared\fR, or
\&\fBdefault\fR.  \fB\-aarchive\fR is functionally equivalent to
\&\fB\-Bstatic\fR, and the other two keywords are functionally equivalent
to \fB\-Bdynamic\fR.  This option may be used any number of times.
.IP "\fB\-\-audit\fR \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--audit AUDITLIB"
Adds \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`DT_AUDIT\*(C'\fR entry of the dynamic section.
\&\fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR is not checked for existence, nor will it use the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
specified in the library.  If specified multiple times \f(CW\*(C`DT_AUDIT\*(C'\fR
will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use. If the linker
finds an object with an audit entry while searching for shared libraries,
it will add a corresponding \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C'\fR entry in the output file.
This option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms supporting the rtld-audit
interface.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR \fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A architecture"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-architecture=\fR\fIarchitecture\fR" 4
.IX Item "--architecture=architecture"
.PD
In the current release of \fBld\fR, this option is useful only for the
Intel 960 family of architectures.  In that \fBld\fR configuration, the
\&\fIarchitecture\fR argument identifies the particular architecture in
the 960 family, enabling some safeguards and modifying the
archive-library search path.
.Sp
Future releases of \fBld\fR may support similar functionality for
other architecture families.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b input-format"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-format=\fR\fIinput-format\fR" 4
.IX Item "--format=input-format"
.PD
\&\fBld\fR may be configured to support more than one kind of object
file.  If your \fBld\fR is configured this way, you can use the
\&\fB\-b\fR option to specify the binary format for input object files
that follow this option on the command line.  Even when \fBld\fR is
configured to support alternative object formats, you don't usually need
to specify this, as \fBld\fR should be configured to expect as a
default input format the most usual format on each machine.
\&\fIinput-format\fR is a text string, the name of a particular format
supported by the \s-1BFD\s0 libraries.  (You can list the available binary
formats with \fBobjdump \-i\fR.)
.Sp
You may want to use this option if you are linking files with an unusual
binary format.  You can also use \fB\-b\fR to switch formats explicitly (when
linking object files of different formats), by including
\&\fB\-b\fR \fIinput-format\fR before each group of object files in a
particular format.
.Sp
The default format is taken from the environment variable
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
You can also define the input format from a script, using the command
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR;
.IP "\fB\-c\fR \fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "-c MRI-commandfile"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-mri\-script=\fR\fIMRI-commandfile\fR" 4
.IX Item "--mri-script=MRI-commandfile"
.PD
For compatibility with linkers produced by \s-1MRI, \s0\fBld\fR accepts script
files written in an alternate, restricted command language, described in
the \s-1MRI\s0 Compatible Script Files section of \s-1GNU\s0 ld documentation.
Introduce \s-1MRI\s0 script files with
the option \fB\-c\fR; use the \fB\-T\fR option to run linker
scripts written in the general-purpose \fBld\fR scripting language.
If \fIMRI-cmdfile\fR does not exist, \fBld\fR looks for it in the directories
specified by any \fB\-L\fR options.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-dc\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dc"
.IP "\fB\-dp\fR" 4
.IX Item "-dp"
.PD
These three options are equivalent; multiple forms are supported for
compatibility with other linkers.  They assign space to common symbols
even if a relocatable output file is specified (with \fB\-r\fR).  The
script command \f(CW\*(C`FORCE_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.IP "\fB\-\-depaudit\fR \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "--depaudit AUDITLIB"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-P\fR \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR" 4
.IX Item "-P AUDITLIB"
.PD
Adds \fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR to the \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C'\fR entry of the dynamic section.
\&\fI\s-1AUDITLIB\s0\fR is not checked for existence, nor will it use the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
specified in the library.  If specified multiple times \f(CW\*(C`DT_DEPAUDIT\*(C'\fR
will contain a colon separated list of audit interfaces to use.  This
option is only meaningful on \s-1ELF\s0 platforms supporting the rtld-audit interface.
The \-P option is provided for Solaris compatibility.
.IP "\fB\-e\fR \fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e entry"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-entry=\fR\fIentry\fR" 4
.IX Item "--entry=entry"
.PD
Use \fIentry\fR as the explicit symbol for beginning execution of your
program, rather than the default entry point.  If there is no symbol
named \fIentry\fR, the linker will try to parse \fIentry\fR as a number,
and use that as the entry address (the number will be interpreted in
base 10; you may use a leading \fB0x\fR for base 16, or a leading
\&\fB0\fR for base 8).
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-libs\fR \fIlib\fR\fB,\fR\fIlib\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-libs lib,lib,..."
Specifies a list of archive libraries from which symbols should not be automatically
exported.  The library names may be delimited by commas or colons.  Specifying
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-exclude\-libs ALL\*(C'\fR excludes symbols in all archive libraries from
automatic export.  This option is available only for the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted
port of the linker and for \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports.  For i386 \s-1PE,\s0 symbols
explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported, regardless of this
option.  For \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports, symbols affected by this option will
be treated as hidden.
.IP "\fB\-\-exclude\-modules\-for\-implib\fR \fImodule\fR\fB,\fR\fImodule\fR\fB,...\fR" 4
.IX Item "--exclude-modules-for-implib module,module,..."
Specifies a list of object files or archive members, from which symbols
should not be automatically exported, but which should be copied wholesale
into the import library being generated during the link.  The module names
may be delimited by commas or colons, and must match exactly the filenames
used by \fBld\fR to open the files; for archive members, this is simply
the member name, but for object files the name listed must include and
match precisely any path used to specify the input file on the linker's
command-line.  This option is available only for the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port
of the linker.  Symbols explicitly listed in a .def file are still exported,
regardless of this option.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-export\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-dynamic"
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-export\-dynamic\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-export-dynamic"
.PD
When creating a dynamically linked executable, using the \fB\-E\fR
option or the \fB\-\-export\-dynamic\fR option causes the linker to add
all symbols to the dynamic symbol table.  The dynamic symbol table is the
set of symbols which are visible from dynamic objects at run time.
.Sp
If you do not use either of these options (or use the
\&\fB\-\-no\-export\-dynamic\fR option to restore the default behavior), the
dynamic symbol table will normally contain only those symbols which are
referenced by some dynamic object mentioned in the link.
.Sp
If you use \f(CW\*(C`dlopen\*(C'\fR to load a dynamic object which needs to refer
back to the symbols defined by the program, rather than some other
dynamic object, then you will probably need to use this option when
linking the program itself.
.Sp
You can also use the dynamic list to control what symbols should
be added to the dynamic symbol table if the output format supports it.
See the description of \fB\-\-dynamic\-list\fR.
.Sp
Note that this option is specific to \s-1ELF\s0 targeted ports.  \s-1PE\s0 targets
support a similar function to export all symbols from a \s-1DLL\s0 or \s-1EXE\s0; see
the description of \fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR below.
.IP "\fB\-EB\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EB"
Link big-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-EL\fR" 4
.IX Item "-EL"
Link little-endian objects.  This affects the default output format.
.IP "\fB\-f\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-f name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-auxiliary=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--auxiliary=name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field
to the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol
table of the shared object should be used as an auxiliary filter on the
symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 field.  If
the dynamic linker resolves any symbols from the filter object, it will
first check whether there is a definition in the shared object
\&\fIname\fR.  If there is one, it will be used instead of the definition
in the filter object.  The shared object \fIname\fR need not exist.
Thus the shared object \fIname\fR may be used to provide an alternative
implementation of certain functions, perhaps for debugging or for
machine specific performance.
.Sp
This option may be specified more than once.  The \s-1DT_AUXILIARY\s0 entries
will be created in the order in which they appear on the command line.
.IP "\fB\-F\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-F name"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-filter=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--filter=name"
.PD
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field to
the specified name.  This tells the dynamic linker that the symbol table
of the shared object which is being created should be used as a filter
on the symbol table of the shared object \fIname\fR.
.Sp
If you later link a program against this filter object, then, when you
run the program, the dynamic linker will see the \s-1DT_FILTER\s0 field.  The
dynamic linker will resolve symbols according to the symbol table of the
filter object as usual, but it will actually link to the definitions
found in the shared object \fIname\fR.  Thus the filter object can be
used to select a subset of the symbols provided by the object
\&\fIname\fR.
.Sp
Some older linkers used the \fB\-F\fR option throughout a compilation
toolchain for specifying object-file format for both input and output
object files.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker uses other mechanisms for this purpose: the
\&\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-format\fR, \fB\-\-oformat\fR options, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`TARGET\*(C'\fR command in linker scripts, and the \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR
environment variable.
The \s-1GNU\s0 linker will ignore the \fB\-F\fR option when not
creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object.
.IP "\fB\-fini=\fR\fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "-fini=name"
When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is unloaded, by setting \s-1DT_FINI\s0 to the
address of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_fini\*(C'\fR as
the function to call.
.IP "\fB\-g\fR" 4
.IX Item "-g"
Ignored.  Provided for compatibility with other tools.
.IP "\fB\-G\fR \fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "-G value"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-gpsize=\fR\fIvalue\fR" 4
.IX Item "--gpsize=value"
.PD
Set the maximum size of objects to be optimized using the \s-1GP\s0 register to

When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 shared object, set the internal \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field to
the specified name.  When an executable is linked with a shared object
which has a \s-1DT_SONAME\s0 field, then when the executable is run the dynamic
linker will attempt to load the shared object specified by the \s-1DT_SONAME\s0
field rather than the using the file name given to the linker.

Perform an incremental link (same as option \fB\-r\fR).

When creating an \s-1ELF\s0 executable or shared object, call \s-1NAME\s0 when the
executable or shared object is loaded, by setting \s-1DT_INIT\s0 to the address
of the function.  By default, the linker uses \f(CW\*(C`_init\*(C'\fR as the
function to call.

.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-library=\fR\fInamespec\fR" 4
.IX Item "--library=namespec"
.PD
Add the archive or object file specified by \fInamespec\fR to the
list of files to link.  This option may be used any number of times.
If \fInamespec\fR is of the form \fI:\fIfilename\fI\fR, \fBld\fR
will search the library path for a file called \fIfilename\fR, otherwise it
will search the library path for a file called \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.
.Sp
On systems which support shared libraries, \fBld\fR may also search for
files other than \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.  Specifically, on \s-1ELF\s0
and SunOS systems, \fBld\fR will search a directory for a library
called \fIlib\fInamespec\fI.so\fR before searching for one called
\&\fIlib\fInamespec\fI.a\fR.  (By convention, a \f(CW\*(C`.so\*(C'\fR extension
indicates a shared library.)  Note that this behavior does not apply
to \fI:\fIfilename\fI\fR, which always specifies a file called
\&\fIfilename\fR.
.Sp
The linker will search an archive only once, at the location where it is
specified on the command line.  If the archive defines a symbol which
was undefined in some object which appeared before the archive on the
command line, the linker will include the appropriate file(s) from the
archive.  However, an undefined symbol in an object appearing later on
the command line will not cause the linker to search the archive again.
.Sp
See the \fB\-(\fR option for a way to force the linker to search
archives multiple times.
.Sp
You may list the same archive multiple times on the command line.
.Sp
This type of archive searching is standard for Unix linkers.  However,
if you are using \fBld\fR on \s-1AIX,\s0 note that it is different from the
behaviour of the \s-1AIX\s0 linker.

.PD
Add path \fIsearchdir\fR to the list of paths that \fBld\fR will search
for archive libraries and \fBld\fR control scripts.  You may use this
option any number of times.  The directories are searched in the order
in which they are specified on the command line.  Directories specified
on the command line are searched before the default directories.  All
\&\fB\-L\fR options apply to all \fB\-l\fR options, regardless of the
order in which the options appear.  \fB\-L\fR options do not affect
how \fBld\fR searches for a linker script unless \fB\-T\fR
option is specified.
.Sp
If \fIsearchdir\fR begins with \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, then the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR will be replaced
by the \fIsysroot prefix\fR, controlled by the \fB\-\-sysroot\fR option, or
specified when the linker is configured.
.Sp
The default set of paths searched (without being specified with
\&\fB\-L\fR) depends on which emulation mode \fBld\fR is using, and in
some cases also on how it was configured.
.Sp
The paths can also be specified in a link script with the
\&\f(CW\*(C`SEARCH_DIR\*(C'\fR command.  Directories specified this way are searched
at the point in which the linker script appears in the command line.
.IP "\fB\-m\fR \fIemulation\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m emulation"
Emulate the \fIemulation\fR linker.  You can list the available
emulations with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.
.Sp
If the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, the emulation is taken from the
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR environment variable, if that is defined.
.Sp
Otherwise, the default emulation depends upon how the linker was
configured.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-print\-map\fR" 4
.IX Item "--print-map"
.PD
Print a link map to the standard output.  A link map provides
information about the link, including the following:
.RS 4
.IP "\(bu" 4
Where object files are mapped into memory.
.IP "\(bu" 4
How common symbols are allocated.
.IP "\(bu" 4
All archive members included in the link, with a mention of the symbol
which caused the archive member to be brought in.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The values assigned to symbols.
.Sp
Note \- symbols whose values are computed by an expression which
involves a reference to a previous value of the same symbol may not
have correct result displayed in the link map.  This is because the
linker discards intermediate results and only retains the final value
of an expression.  Under such circumstances the linker will display
the final value enclosed by square brackets.  Thus for example a
linker script containing:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&           foo = 1
\&           foo = foo * 4
\&           foo = foo + 8
.Ve
.Sp
will produce the following output in the link map if the \fB\-M\fR
option is used:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&           0x00000001                foo = 0x1
\&           [0x0000000c]                foo = (foo * 0x4)

This option negates most of the effects of the \fB\-N\fR option.  It

If \fIlevel\fR is a numeric values greater than zero \fBld\fR optimizes
the output.  This might take significantly longer and therefore probably
should only be enabled for the final binary.  At the moment this
option only affects \s-1ELF\s0 shared library generation.  Future releases of
the linker may make more use of this option.  Also currently there is
no difference in the linker's behaviour for different non-zero values
of this option.  Again this may change with future releases.
.IP "\fB\-\-push\-state\fR" 4

.Sp
One target for this option are specifications for \fIpkg-config\fR.  When

Generate relocatable output\-\-\-i.e., generate an output file that can in
turn serve as input to \fBld\fR.  This is often called \fIpartial
linking\fR.  As a side effect, in environments that support standard Unix
magic numbers, this option also sets the output file's magic number to
\&\f(CW\*(C`OMAGIC\*(C'\fR.
If this option is not specified, an absolute file is produced.  When
linking \*(C+ programs, this option \fIwill not\fR resolve references to
constructors; to do that, use \fB\-Ur\fR.
.Sp
When an input file does not have the same format as the output file,
partial linking is only supported if that input file does not contain any
relocations.  Different output formats can have further restrictions; for
example some \f(CW\*(C`a.out\*(C'\fR\-based formats do not support partial linking
with input files in other formats at all.

Use \fIscriptfile\fR as the linker script.  This script replaces
\&\fBld\fR's default linker script (rather than adding to it), so
\&\fIcommandfile\fR must specify everything necessary to describe the
output file.    If \fIscriptfile\fR does not exist in
the current directory, \f(CW\*(C`ld\*(C'\fR looks for it in the directories

Use \fIscriptfile\fR as the default linker script.
.Sp
This option is similar to the \fB\-\-script\fR option except that
processing of the script is delayed until after the rest of the
command line has been processed.  This allows options placed after the
\&\fB\-\-default\-script\fR option on the command line to affect the
behaviour of the linker script, which can be important when the linker
command line cannot be directly controlled by the user.  (eg because
the command line is being constructed by another tool, such as

Force \fIsymbol\fR to be entered in the output file as an undefined

different option arguments to enter additional undefined symbols.  This
option is equivalent to the \f(CW\*(C`EXTERN\*(C'\fR linker script command.

If this option is being used to force additional modules to be pulled

instead.

Require that \fIsymbol\fR is defined in the output file.  This option
is the same as option \fB\-\-undefined\fR except that if \fIsymbol\fR
is not defined in the output file then the linker will issue an error
and exit.  The same effect can be achieved in a linker script by using
\&\f(CW\*(C`EXTERN\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`ASSERT\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`DEFINED\*(C'\fR together.  This option
can be used multiple times to require additional symbols.

For anything other than \*(C+ programs, this option is equivalent to

turn serve as input to \fBld\fR.  When linking \*(C+ programs, \fB\-Ur\fR
\&\fIdoes\fR resolve references to constructors, unlike \fB\-r\fR.
It does not work to use \fB\-Ur\fR on files that were themselves linked
with \fB\-Ur\fR; once the constructor table has been built, it cannot
be added to.  Use \fB\-Ur\fR only for the last partial link, and

The \fIarchives\fR should be a list of archive files.  They may be
either explicit file names, or \fB\-l\fR options.
.Sp
The specified archives are searched repeatedly until no new undefined
references are created.  Normally, an archive is searched only once in
the order that it is specified on the command line.  If a symbol in that
archive is needed to resolve an undefined symbol referred to by an
object in an archive that appears later on the command line, the linker
would not be able to resolve that reference.  By grouping the archives,
they all be searched repeatedly until all possible references are
resolved.
.Sp
Using this option has a significant performance cost.  It is best to use
it only when there are unavoidable circular references between two or
more archives.

Tells the linker to accept input files whose architecture cannot be

and deliberately wants to link in these unknown input files.  This was
the default behaviour of the linker, before release 2.14.  The default

This option affects \s-1ELF DT_NEEDED\s0 tags for dynamic libraries mentioned
on the command line after the \fB\-\-as\-needed\fR option.  Normally
the linker will add a \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tag for each dynamic library mentioned

needed or not.  \fB\-\-as\-needed\fR causes a \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tag to only be
emitted for a library that \fIat that point in the link\fR satisfies a
non-weak undefined symbol reference from a regular object file or, if
the library is not found in the \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 lists of other needed libraries, a
non-weak undefined symbol reference from another needed dynamic library.
Object files or libraries appearing on the command line \fIafter\fR

This option affects the treatment of dynamic libraries referred to

input dynamic library.  With \fB\-\-copy\-dt\-needed\-entries\fR

This option also has an effect on the resolution of symbols in dynamic

mentioned on the command line will be recursively searched, following
their \s-1DT_NEEDED\s0 tags to other libraries, in order to resolve symbols

Output a cross reference table.  If a linker map file is being

Otherwise, it is printed on the standard output.
.Sp
The format of the table is intentionally simple, so that it may be
easily processed by a script if necessary.  The symbols are printed out,
sorted by name.  For each symbol, a list of file names is given.  If the
symbol is defined, the first file listed is the location of the
definition.  If the symbol is defined as a common value then any files
where this happens appear next.  Finally any files that reference the
symbol are listed.

.IX Item "--no-define-common"
This option inhibits the assignment of addresses to common symbols.
The script command \f(CW\*(C`INHIBIT_COMMON_ALLOCATION\*(C'\fR has the same effect.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR option allows decoupling
the decision to assign addresses to Common symbols from the choice
of the output file type; otherwise a non-Relocatable output type
forces assigning addresses to Common symbols.
Using \fB\-\-no\-define\-common\fR allows Common symbols that are referenced
from a shared library to be assigned addresses only in the main program.
This eliminates the unused duplicate space in the shared library,
and also prevents any possible confusion over resolving to the wrong
duplicate when there are many dynamic modules with specialized search
paths for runtime symbol resolution.

mangled symbol names into user readable names.  Different compilers have
different mangling styles.  The optional demangling style argument can be used
to choose an appropriate demangling style for your compiler.  The linker will

\&\fB\-\-gc\-sections\fR decides which input sections are used by
examining symbols and relocations.  The section containing the entry
symbol and all sections containing symbols undefined on the

referenced.  Once this initial set of sections has been determined,
the linker recursively marks as used any section referenced by their
relocations.  See \fB\-\-entry\fR and \fB\-\-undefined\fR.

The default behaviour is to report errors for any undefined symbols
referenced in shared libraries if the linker is being used to create

The reasons for allowing undefined symbol references in shared
libraries specified at link time are that:

A shared library specified at link time may not be the same as the one

The \fB\-rpath\fR option may also be used on SunOS.  By default, on

the \fB\-rpath\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-rpath\-link=\fR\fIdir\fR" 4
.IX Item "-rpath-link=dir"
When using \s-1ELF\s0 or SunOS, one shared library may require another.  This
happens when an \f(CW\*(C`ld \-shared\*(C'\fR link includes a shared library as one
of the input files.
.Sp
When the linker encounters such a dependency when doing a non-shared,
non-relocatable link, it will automatically try to locate the required
shared library and include it in the link, if it is not included
explicitly.  In such a case, the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option
specifies the first set of directories to search.  The
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR option may specify a sequence of directory names
either by specifying a list of names separated by colons, or by
appearing multiple times.
.Sp
This option should be used with caution as it overrides the search path
that may have been hard compiled into a shared library. In such a case it
is possible to use unintentionally a different search path than the
runtime linker would do.
.Sp
The linker uses the following search paths to locate required shared
libraries:
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
Any directories specified by \fB\-rpath\-link\fR options.
.IP "2." 4
Any directories specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options.  The difference
between \fB\-rpath\fR and \fB\-rpath\-link\fR is that directories
specified by \fB\-rpath\fR options are included in the executable and
used at runtime, whereas the \fB\-rpath\-link\fR option is only effective
at link time. Searching \fB\-rpath\fR in this way is only supported
by native linkers and cross linkers which have been configured with
the \fB\-\-with\-sysroot\fR option.
.IP "3." 4
On an \s-1ELF\s0 system, for native linkers, if the \fB\-rpath\fR and
\&\fB\-rpath\-link\fR options were not used, search the contents of the
environment variable \f(CW\*(C`LD_RUN_PATH\*(C'\fR.
.IP "4." 4
On SunOS, if the \fB\-rpath\fR option was not used, search any
directories specified using \fB\-L\fR options.
.IP "5." 4
For a native linker, search the contents of the environment
variable \f(CW\*(C`LD_LIBRARY_PATH\*(C'\fR.
.IP "6." 4
For a native \s-1ELF\s0 linker, the directories in \f(CW\*(C`DT_RUNPATH\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`DT_RPATH\*(C'\fR of a shared library are searched for shared
libraries needed by it. The \f(CW\*(C`DT_RPATH\*(C'\fR entries are ignored if
\&\f(CW\*(C`DT_RUNPATH\*(C'\fR entries exist.
.IP "7." 4
The default directories, normally \fI/lib\fR and \fI/usr/lib\fR.
.IP "8." 4
For a native linker on an \s-1ELF\s0 system, if the file \fI/etc/ld.so.conf\fR
exists, the list of directories found in that file.

eight-byte, four-byte, two-byte, and one-byte. This is to prevent gaps

This is useful when generating huge relocatable files for downloading into
certain real time kernels with the \s-1COFF\s0 object file format; since \s-1COFF\s0
cannot represent more than 65535 relocations in a single section.  Note
that this will fail to work with object file formats which do not
support arbitrary sections.  The linker will not split up individual
input sections for redistribution, so if a single input section contains

For example, on SunOS, \fBld\fR combines duplicate entries in the

full debugging information by over 30 percent.  Unfortunately, the SunOS

Warn when a common symbol is combined with another common symbol or with
a symbol definition.  Unix linkers allow this somewhat sloppy practice,

you to find potential problems from combining global symbols.
Unfortunately, some C libraries use this practice, so you may get some
warnings about symbols in the libraries as well as in your programs.
.Sp
There are three kinds of global symbols, illustrated here by C examples:
.RS 4
.IP "\fBint i = 1;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i = 1;"
A definition, which goes in the initialized data section of the output
file.
.IP "\fBextern int i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "extern int i;"
An undefined reference, which does not allocate space.
There must be either a definition or a common symbol for the
variable somewhere.
.IP "\fBint i;\fR" 4
.IX Item "int i;"
A common symbol.  If there are only (one or more) common symbols for a
variable, it goes in the uninitialized data area of the output file.
The linker merges multiple common symbols for the same variable into a
single symbol.  If they are of different sizes, it picks the largest
size.  The linker turns a common symbol into a declaration, if there is
a definition of the same variable.
.RE

The \fB\-\-warn\-common\fR option can produce five kinds of warnings.

a common symbol.

Warn if any global constructors are used.  This is only useful for a few

detect the use of global constructors.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-multiple\-gp\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-multiple-gp"
Warn if multiple global pointer values are required in the output file.
This is only meaningful for certain processors, such as the Alpha.
Specifically, some processors put large-valued constants in a special
section.  A special register (the global pointer) points into the middle
of this section, so that constants can be loaded efficiently via a
base-register relative addressing mode.  Since the offset in
base-register relative mode is fixed and relatively small (e.g., 16
bits), this limits the maximum size of the constant pool.  Thus, in
large programs, it is often necessary to use multiple global pointer
values in order to be able to address all possible constants.  This
option causes a warning to be issued whenever this case occurs.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-once\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-once"
Only warn once for each undefined symbol, rather than once per module
which refers to it.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-section\-align\fR" 4
.IX Item "--warn-section-align"
Warn if the address of an output section is changed because of
alignment.  Typically, the alignment will be set by an input section.
The address will only be changed if it not explicitly specified; that
is, if the \f(CW\*(C`SECTIONS\*(C'\fR command does not specify a start address for
the section.
.IP "\fB\-\-warn\-shared\-textrel\fR" 4

Warn if an object has alternate \s-1ELF\s0 machine code.

If the linker is going to report an unresolved symbol (see the option

This option makes it generate a warning instead.
.IP "\fB\-\-error\-unresolved\-symbols\fR" 4

This restores the linker's default behaviour of generating errors when
it is reporting unresolved symbols.
.IP "\fB\-\-whole\-archive\fR" 4
.IX Item "--whole-archive"
For each archive mentioned on the command line after the
\&\fB\-\-whole\-archive\fR option, include every object file in the archive
in the link, rather than searching the archive for the required object
files.  This is normally used to turn an archive file into a shared
library, forcing every object to be included in the resulting shared
library.  This option may be used more than once.
.Sp
Two notes when using this option from gcc: First, gcc doesn't know
about this option, so you have to use \fB\-Wl,\-whole\-archive\fR.
Second, don't forget to use \fB\-Wl,\-no\-whole\-archive\fR after your
list of archives, because gcc will add its own list of archives to
your link and you may not want this flag to affect those as well.
.IP "\fB\-\-wrap=\fR\fIsymbol\fR" 4
.IX Item "--wrap=symbol"
Use a wrapper function for \fIsymbol\fR.  Any undefined reference to
\&\fIsymbol\fR will be resolved to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  Any
undefined reference to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR will be resolved to
\&\fIsymbol\fR.
.Sp
This can be used to provide a wrapper for a system function.  The
wrapper function should be called \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.  If it
wishes to call the system function, it should call
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_\f(CIsymbol\f(CW\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Here is a trivial example:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&        void *
\&        _\|_wrap_malloc (size_t c)
\&        {
\&          printf ("malloc called with %zu\en", c);
\&          return _\|_real_malloc (c);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
If you link other code with this file using \fB\-\-wrap malloc\fR, then
all calls to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR will call the function \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR
instead.  The call to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR will
call the real \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR function.
.Sp
You may wish to provide a \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR function as well, so that
links without the \fB\-\-wrap\fR option will succeed.  If you do this,
you should not put the definition of \f(CW\*(C`_\|_real_malloc\*(C'\fR in the same
file as \f(CW\*(C`_\|_wrap_malloc\*(C'\fR; if you do, the assembler may resolve the
call before the linker has a chance to wrap it to \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR.

support additional command line options that are specific to the i386
\&\s-1PE\s0 target.  Options that take values may be separated from their
values by either a space or an equals sign.
.IP "\fB\-\-add\-stdcall\-alias\fR" 4
.IX Item "--add-stdcall-alias"
If given, symbols with a stdcall suffix (@\fInn\fR) will be exported
as-is and also with the suffix stripped.

.IX Item "--disable-long-section-names"
.PD
The \s-1PE\s0 variants of the \s-1COFF\s0 object format add an extension that permits
the use of section names longer than eight characters, the normal limit
for \s-1COFF. \s0 By default, these names are only allowed in object files, as
fully-linked executable images do not carry the \s-1COFF\s0 string table required
to support the longer names.  As a \s-1GNU\s0 extension, it is possible to
allow their use in executable images as well, or to (probably pointlessly!)
disallow it in object files, by using these two options.  Executable images
generated with these long section names are slightly non-standard, carrying
as they do a string table, and may generate confusing output when examined
with non-GNU PE-aware tools, such as file viewers and dumpers.  However,
\&\s-1GDB\s0 relies on the use of \s-1PE\s0 long section names to find Dwarf\-2 debug
information sections in an executable image at runtime, and so if neither
option is specified on the command-line, \fBld\fR will enable long
section names, overriding the default and technically correct behaviour,
when it finds the presence of debug information while linking an executable
image and not stripping symbols.
[This option is valid for all \s-1PE\s0 targeted ports of the linker]

.IX Item "--disable-stdcall-fixup"
.PD
If the link finds a symbol that it cannot resolve, it will attempt to
do \*(L"fuzzy linking\*(R" by looking for another defined symbol that differs
only in the format of the symbol name (cdecl vs stdcall) and will
resolve that symbol by linking to the match.  For example, the
undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_foo\*(C'\fR might be linked to the function
\&\f(CW\*(C`_foo@12\*(C'\fR, or the undefined symbol \f(CW\*(C`_bar@16\*(C'\fR might be linked
to the function \f(CW\*(C`_bar\*(C'\fR.  When the linker does this, it prints a
warning, since it normally should have failed to link, but sometimes
import libraries generated from third-party dlls may need this feature
to be usable.  If you specify \fB\-\-enable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this
feature is fully enabled and warnings are not printed.  If you specify
\&\fB\-\-disable\-stdcall\-fixup\fR, this feature is disabled and such
mismatches are considered to be errors.

.IP "\fB\-\-export\-all\-symbols\fR" 4
.IX Item "--export-all-symbols"
If given, all global symbols in the objects used to build a \s-1DLL\s0 will
be exported by the \s-1DLL. \s0 Note that this is the default if there
otherwise wouldn't be any exported symbols.  When symbols are
explicitly exported via \s-1DEF\s0 files or implicitly exported via function
attributes, the default is to not export anything else unless this
option is given.  Note that the symbols \f(CW\*(C`DllMain@12\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`DllEntryPoint@0\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`DllMainCRTStartup@12\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`impure_ptr\*(C'\fR will not be automatically
exported.  Also, symbols imported from other DLLs will not be
re-exported, nor will symbols specifying the \s-1DLL\s0's internal layout
such as those beginning with \f(CW\*(C`_head_\*(C'\fR or ending with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_iname\*(C'\fR.  In addition, no symbols from \f(CW\*(C`libgcc\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`libstd++\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`libmingw32\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`crtX.o\*(C'\fR will be exported.
Symbols whose names begin with \f(CW\*(C`_\|_rtti_\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`_\|_builtin_\*(C'\fR will
not be exported, to help with \*(C+ DLLs.  Finally, there is an
extensive list of cygwin-private symbols that are not exported
(obviously, this applies on when building DLLs for cygwin targets).
These cygwin-excludes are: \f(CW\*(C`_cygwin_dll_entry@12\*(C'\fR,

.IX Item "--output-def file"
The linker will create the file \fIfile\fR which will contain a \s-1DEF\s0
file corresponding to the \s-1DLL\s0 the linker is generating.  This \s-1DEF\s0 file
(which should be called \f(CW\*(C`*.def\*(C'\fR) may be used to create an import
library with \f(CW\*(C`dlltool\*(C'\fR or may be used as a reference to
automatically or implicitly exported symbols.

The linker will create the file \fIfile\fR which will contain an
import lib corresponding to the \s-1DLL\s0 the linker is generating. This
import lib (which should be called \f(CW\*(C`*.dll.a\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`*.a\*(C'\fR
may be used to link clients against the generated \s-1DLL\s0; this behaviour
makes it possible to skip a separate \f(CW\*(C`dlltool\*(C'\fR import library
creation step.

.IP "\fB\-\-dll\-search\-prefix\fR \fIstring\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dll-search-prefix string"
When linking dynamically to a dll without an import library,
search for \f(CW\*(C`<string><basename>.dll\*(C'\fR in preference to
\&\f(CW\*(C`lib<basename>.dll\*(C'\fR. This behaviour allows easy distinction
between DLLs built for the various \*(L"subplatforms\*(R": native, cygwin,
uwin, pw, etc.  For instance, cygwin DLLs typically use
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-\-dll\-search\-prefix=cyg\*(C'\fR.
[This option is specific to the i386 \s-1PE\s0 targeted port of the linker]
.IP "\fB\-\-enable\-auto\-import\fR" 4
.IX Item "--enable-auto-import"
Do sophisticated linking of \f(CW\*(C`_symbol\*(C'\fR to \f(CW\*(C`_\|_imp_\|_symbol\*(C'\fR for
\&\s-1DATA\s0 imports from DLLs, and create the necessary thunking symbols when
building the import libraries with those \s-1DATA\s0 exports. Note: Use of the
\&'auto\-import' extension will cause the text section of the image file
to be made writable. This does not conform to the PE-COFF format
specification published by Microsoft.
.Sp
Note \- use of the 'auto\-import' extension will also cause read only
data which would normally be placed into the .rdata section to be
placed into the .data section instead.  This is in order to work
around a problem with consts that is described here:
http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2004\-09/msg01101.html
.Sp
Using 'auto\-import' generally will 'just work' \*(-- but sometimes you may
see this message:
.Sp
"variable '<var>' can't be auto-imported. Please read the
documentation for ld's \f(CW\*(C`\-\-enable\-auto\-import\*(C'\fR for details."
.Sp
This message occurs when some (sub)expression accesses an address
ultimately given by the sum of two constants (Win32 import tables only
allow one).  Instances where this may occur include accesses to member
fields of struct variables imported from a \s-1DLL,\s0 as well as using a
constant index into an array variable imported from a \s-1DLL. \s0 Any
multiword variable (arrays, structs, long long, etc) may trigger
this error condition.  However, regardless of the exact data type
of the offending exported variable, ld will always detect it, issue
the warning, and exit.
.Sp
There are several ways to address this difficulty, regardless of the
data type of the exported variable:
.Sp
One way is to use \-\-enable\-runtime\-pseudo\-reloc switch. This leaves the task
of adjusting references in your client code for runtime environment, so
this method works only when runtime environment supports this feature.
.Sp
A second solution is to force one of the 'constants' to be a variable \*(--
that is, unknown and un-optimizable at compile time.  For arrays,
there are two possibilities: a) make the indexee (the array's address)
a variable, or b) make the 'constant' index a variable.  Thus:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] \-\->
\&           { volatile type *t=extern_array; t[1] }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern type extern_array[];
\&        extern_array[1] \-\->
\&           { volatile int t=1; extern_array[t] }
.Ve
.Sp
For structs (and most other multiword data types) the only option
is to make the struct itself (or the long long, or the ...) variable:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern struct s extern_struct;
\&        extern_struct.field \-\->
\&           { volatile struct s *t=&extern_struct; t\->field }
.Ve
.Sp
or
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&        extern long long extern_ll;
\&        extern_ll \-\->
\&          { volatile long long * local_ll=&extern_ll; *local_ll }
.Ve
.Sp
A third method of dealing with this difficulty is to abandon
\&'auto\-import' for the offending symbol and mark it with
\&\f(CW\*(C`_\|_declspec(dllimport)\*(C'\fR.  However, in practice that
requires using compile-time #defines to indicate whether you are
building a \s-1DLL,\s0 building client code that will link to the \s-1DLL,\s0 or
merely building/linking to a static library.   In making the choice
between the various methods of resolving the 'direct address with
constant offset' problem, you should consider typical real-world usage:
.Sp
Original:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&        \-\-foo.h
\&        extern int arr[];
\&        \-\-foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"

\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          /* This workaround is for win32 and cygwin; do not "optimize" */
\&          volatile int *parr = arr;
\&          printf("%d\en",parr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
Solution 2:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&        \-\-foo.h
\&        /* Note: auto\-export is assumed (no _\|_declspec(dllexport)) */
\&        #if (defined(_WIN32) || defined(_\|_CYGWIN_\|_)) && \e
\&          !(defined(FOO_BUILD_DLL) || defined(FOO_STATIC))
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT _\|_declspec(dllimport)
\&        #else
\&        #define FOO_IMPORT
\&        #endif
\&        extern FOO_IMPORT int arr[];
\&        \-\-foo.c
\&        #include "foo.h"
\&        void main(int argc, char **argv){
\&          printf("%d\en",arr[1]);
\&        }
.Ve
.Sp
A fourth way to avoid this problem is to re-code your
library to use a functional interface rather than a data interface
for the offending variables (e.g. \fIset_foo()\fR and \fIget_foo()\fR accessor
functions).

.IX Item "--dsbt-size size"
This option sets the number of entries in the \s-1DSBT\s0 of the current executable
or shared library to \fIsize\fR.  The default is to create a table with 64
entries.
.IP "\fB\-\-dsbt\-index\fR \fIindex\fR" 4
.IX Item "--dsbt-index index"
This option sets the \s-1DSBT\s0 index of the current executable or shared library
to \fIindex\fR.  The default is 0, which is appropriate for generating
executables.  If a shared library is generated with a \s-1DSBT\s0 index of 0, the
\&\f(CW\*(C`R_C6000_DSBT_INDEX\*(C'\fR relocs are copied into the output file.
.Sp
The \fB\-\-no\-merge\-exidx\-entries\fR switch disables the merging of adjacent
exidx entries in frame unwind info.
.PP
The 68HC11 and 68HC12 linkers support specific options to control the
memory bank switching mapping and trampoline code generation.
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-trampoline\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-trampoline"
This option disables the generation of trampoline. By default a trampoline
is generated for each far function which is called using a \f(CW\*(C`jsr\*(C'\fR
instruction (this happens when a pointer to a far function is taken).
.IP "\fB\-\-bank\-window\fR \fIname\fR" 4
.IX Item "--bank-window name"
This option indicates to the linker the name of the memory region in
the \fB\s-1MEMORY\s0\fR specification that describes the memory bank window.
The definition of such region is then used by the linker to compute
paging and addresses within the memory window.
.PP
The following options are supported to control handling of \s-1GOT\s0 generation
when linking for 68K targets.
.IP "\fB\-\-got=\fR\fItype\fR" 4
.IX Item "--got=type"
This option tells the linker which \s-1GOT\s0 generation scheme to use.
\&\fItype\fR should be one of \fBsingle\fR, \fBnegative\fR,
\&\fBmultigot\fR or \fBtarget\fR.  For more information refer to the
Info entry for \fIld\fR.
.PP
The following options are supported to control microMIPS instruction
generation when linking for \s-1MIPS\s0 targets.
.IP "\fB\-\-insn32\fR" 4
.IX Item "--insn32"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB\-\-no\-insn32\fR" 4
.IX Item "--no-insn32"
.PD
These options control the choice of microMIPS instructions used in code
generated by the linker, such as that in the \s-1PLT\s0 or lazy binding stubs,
or in relaxation.  If \fB\-\-insn32\fR is used, then the linker only uses
32\-bit instruction encodings.  By default or if \fB\-\-no\-insn32\fR is
used, all instruction encodings are used, including 16\-bit ones where
possible.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "ENVIRONMENT"
You can change the behaviour of \fBld\fR with the environment variables
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR,
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR determines the input-file object format if you don't
use \fB\-b\fR (or its synonym \fB\-\-format\fR).  Its value should be one
of the \s-1BFD\s0 names for an input format.  If there is no
\&\f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR in the environment, \fBld\fR uses the natural format
of the target. If \f(CW\*(C`GNUTARGET\*(C'\fR is set to \f(CW\*(C`default\*(C'\fR then \s-1BFD\s0
attempts to discover the input format by examining binary input files;
this method often succeeds, but there are potential ambiguities, since
there is no method of ensuring that the magic number used to specify
object-file formats is unique.  However, the configuration procedure for
\&\s-1BFD\s0 on each system places the conventional format for that system first
in the search-list, so ambiguities are resolved in favor of convention.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR determines the default emulation if you don't use the
\&\fB\-m\fR option.  The emulation can affect various aspects of linker
behaviour, particularly the default linker script.  You can list the
available emulations with the \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-V\fR options.  If
the \fB\-m\fR option is not used, and the \f(CW\*(C`LDEMULATION\*(C'\fR environment
variable is not defined, the default emulation depends upon how the
linker was configured.
.PP
Normally, the linker will default to demangling symbols.  However, if
\&\f(CW\*(C`COLLECT_NO_DEMANGLE\*(C'\fR is set in the environment, then it will
default to not demangling symbols.  This environment variable is used in
a similar fashion by the \f(CW\*(C`gcc\*(C'\fR linker wrapper program.  The default
may be overridden by the \fB\-\-demangle\fR and \fB\-\-no\-demangle\fR
options.
