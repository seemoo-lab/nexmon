/* For MPFR_RNDN, we can have a problem of double rounding.
   In such a case, this table helps to conclude what to do (y positive):
     Rounding Bit |  Sticky Bit | inexact  | Action    | new inexact
     0            |   ?         |  ?       | Trunc     | sticky
     1            |   0         |  1       | Trunc     |
     1            |   0         |  0       | Trunc if even |
     1            |   0         | -1       | AddOneUlp |
     1            |   1         |  ?       | AddOneUlp |

   For other rounding mode, there isn't such a problem.
   Just round it again and merge the ternary values.

   Set the inexact flag if the returned ternary value is non-zero.
   Set the underflow flag if a second rounding occurred (whether this
   rounding is exact or not). See
