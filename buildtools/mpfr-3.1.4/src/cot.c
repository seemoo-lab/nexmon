/* (This analysis is adapted from that for mpfr_coth.)
   Near x=0, cot(x) = 1/x - x/3 + ..., more precisely we have
   |cot(x) - 1/x| <= 0.36 for |x| <= 1. The error term has
   the opposite sign as 1/x, thus |cot(x)| <= |1/x|. Then:
   (i) either x is a power of two, then 1/x is exactly representable, and
       as long as 1/2*ulp(1/x) > 0.36, we can conclude;
   (ii) otherwise assume x has <= n bits, and y has <= n+1 bits, then
   |y - 1/x| >= 2^(-2n) ufp(y), where ufp means unit in first place.
   Since |cot(x) - 1/x| <= 0.36, if 2^(-2n) ufp(y) >= 0.72, then
   |y - cot(x)| >= 2^(-2n-1) ufp(y), and rounding 1/x gives the correct
   result. If x < 2^E, then y > 2^(-E), thus ufp(y) > 2^(-E-1).
   A sufficient condition is thus EXP(x) + 1 <= -2 MAX(PREC(x),PREC(Y)).
   The division can be inexact in case of underflow or overflow; but
   an underflow is not possible as emin = - emax. The overflow is a
   real overflow possibly except when |x| = 2^emin. */
