 /* The computation of y = x^(1/3) is done as follows:

    Let x = sign * m * 2^(3*e) where m is an integer

    with 2^(3n-3) <= m < 2^(3n) where n = PREC(y)

    and m = s^3 + r where 0 <= r and m < (s+1)^3

    we want that s has n bits i.e. s >= 2^(n-1), or m >= 2^(3n-3)
    i.e. m must have at least 3n-2 bits

    then x^(1/3) = s * 2^e if r=0
         x^(1/3) = (s+1) * 2^e if round up
         x^(1/3) = (s-1) * 2^e if round down
         x^(1/3) = s * 2^e if nearest and r < 3/2*s^2+3/4*s+1/8
                   (s+1) * 2^e otherwise
