/* near x=0, we have csc(x) = 1/x + x/6 + ..., more precisely we have
   |csc(x) - 1/x| <= 0.2 for |x| <= 1. The analysis is similar to that for
   gamma(x) near x=0 (see gamma.c), except here the error term has the same
   sign as 1/x, thus |csc(x)| >= |1/x|. Then:
   (i) either x is a power of two, then 1/x is exactly representable, and
       as long as 1/2*ulp(1/x) > 0.2, we can conclude;
   (ii) otherwise assume x has <= n bits, and y has <= n+1 bits, then
   |y - 1/x| >= 2^(-2n) ufp(y), where ufp means unit in first place.
   Since |csc(x) - 1/x| <= 0.2, if 2^(-2n) ufp(y) >= 0.4, then
   |y - csc(x)| >= 2^(-2n-1) ufp(y), and rounding 1/x gives the correct result.
   If x < 2^E, then y > 2^(-E), thus ufp(y) > 2^(-E-1).
   A sufficient condition is thus EXP(x) <= -2 MAX(PREC(x),PREC(Y)). */
