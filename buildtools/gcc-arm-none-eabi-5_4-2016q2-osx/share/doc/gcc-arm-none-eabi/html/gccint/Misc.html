<blockquote><p>Define this macro to be a C expression indicating when insns that read
memory in <var>mem_mode</var>, an integral mode narrower than a word, set the
bits outside of <var>mem_mode</var> to be either the sign-extension or the

of <var>mem_mode</var> for which the
insn sign-extends, <code>ZERO_EXTEND</code> for which it zero-extends, and
<code>UNKNOWN</code> for other modes.

      <p>This macro is not called with <var>mem_mode</var> non-integral or with a width
greater than or equal to <code>BITS_PER_WORD</code>, so you may return any
value in this case.  Do not define this macro if it would always return
<code>UNKNOWN</code>.  On machines where this macro is defined, you will normally
define it as the constant <code>SIGN_EXTEND</code> or <code>ZERO_EXTEND</code>.

      <p>You may return a non-<code>UNKNOWN</code> value even if for some hard registers
the sign extension is not performed, if for the <code>REGNO_REG_CLASS</code>
of these hard registers <code>CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS</code> returns nonzero
when the <var>from</var> mode is <var>mem_mode</var> and the <var>to</var> mode is any
integral mode larger than this but not larger than <code>word_mode</code>.

      <p>You must return <code>UNKNOWN</code> if for some hard registers that allow this
mode, <code>CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS</code> says that they cannot change to
<code>word_mode</code>, but that they can change to another integral mode that
is larger then <var>mem_mode</var> but still smaller than <code>word_mode</code>.

<blockquote><p>When <samp><span class="option">-ffast-math</span></samp> is in effect, GCC tries to optimize
divisions by the same divisor, by turning them into multiplications by
the reciprocal.  This target hook specifies the minimum number of divisions
that should be there for GCC to perform the optimization for a variable

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>MOVE_MAX</b><var><a name="index-MOVE_005fMAX-4902"></a></var><br>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</b><var><a name="index-SHIFT_005fCOUNT_005fTRUNCATED-4904"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression that is nonzero if on this machine the number of bits
actually used for the count of a shift operation is equal to the number
of bits needed to represent the size of the object being shifted.  When
this macro is nonzero, the compiler will assume that it is safe to omit
a sign-extend, zero-extend, and certain bitwise `and' instructions that
truncates the count of a shift operation.  On machines that have
instructions that act on bit-fields at variable positions, which may
include `bit test' instructions, a nonzero <code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code>
also enables deletion of truncations of the values that serve as
arguments to bit-field instructions.

      <p>If both types of instructions truncate the count (for shifts) and
position (for bit-field operations), or if no variable-position bit-field
instructions exist, you should define this macro.

      <p>However, on some machines, such as the 80386 and the 680x0, truncation
only applies to shift operations and not the (real or pretended)
bit-field operations.  Define <code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code> to be zero on
such machines.  Instead, add patterns to the <samp><span class="file">md</span></samp> file that include
the implied truncation of the shift instructions.

      <p>You need not define this macro if it would always have the value of zero. 
</p></blockquote></div>

 <p><a name="TARGET_005fSHIFT_005fTRUNCATION_005fMASK"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Target Hook: unsigned HOST_WIDE_INT <b>TARGET_SHIFT_TRUNCATION_MASK</b> (<var>machine_mode mode</var>)<var><a name="index-TARGET_005fSHIFT_005fTRUNCATION_005fMASK-4905"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This function describes how the standard shift patterns for <var>mode</var>
deal with shifts by negative amounts or by more than the width of the mode. 
See <a href="shift-patterns.html#shift-patterns">shift patterns</a>.

      <p>On many machines, the shift patterns will apply a mask <var>m</var> to the
shift count, meaning that a fixed-width shift of <var>x</var> by <var>y</var> is
equivalent to an arbitrary-width shift of <var>x</var> by <var>y &amp; m</var>.  If
this is true for mode <var>mode</var>, the function should return <var>m</var>,
otherwise it should return 0.  A return value of 0 indicates that no
particular behavior is guaranteed.

      <p>Note that, unlike <code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code>, this function does
<em>not</em> apply to general shift rtxes; it applies only to instructions
that are generated by the named shift patterns.

      <p>The default implementation of this function returns
<code>GET_MODE_BITSIZE (</code><var>mode</var><code>) - 1</code> if <code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code>
and 0 otherwise.  This definition is always safe, but if
<code>SHIFT_COUNT_TRUNCATED</code> is false, and some shift patterns
nevertheless truncate the shift count, you may get better code
by overriding it.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</b> (<var>outprec, inprec</var>)<var><a name="index-TRULY_005fNOOP_005fTRUNCATION-4906"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression which is nonzero if on this machine it is safe to
&ldquo;convert&rdquo; an integer of <var>inprec</var> bits to one of <var>outprec</var>
bits (where <var>outprec</var> is smaller than <var>inprec</var>) by merely
operating on it as if it had only <var>outprec</var> bits.

      <p>On many machines, this expression can be 1.

     <!-- rearranged this, removed the phrase "it is reported that".  this was -->
<!-- to fix an overfull hbox.  -mew 10feb93 -->
<p>When <code>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</code> returns 1 for a pair of sizes for
modes for which <code>MODES_TIEABLE_P</code> is 0, suboptimal code can result. 
If this is the case, making <code>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</code> return 0 in
such cases may improve things. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Target Hook: int <b>TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED</b> (<var>machine_mode mode, machine_mode rep_mode</var>)<var><a name="index-TARGET_005fMODE_005fREP_005fEXTENDED-4907"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The representation of an integral mode can be such that the values
are always extended to a wider integral mode.  Return
<code>SIGN_EXTEND</code> if values of <var>mode</var> are represented in
sign-extended form to <var>rep_mode</var>.  Return <code>UNKNOWN</code>
otherwise.  (Currently, none of the targets use zero-extended
representation this way so unlike <code>LOAD_EXTEND_OP</code>,
<code>TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED</code> is expected to return either
<code>SIGN_EXTEND</code> or <code>UNKNOWN</code>.  Also no target extends
<var>mode</var> to <var>rep_mode</var> so that <var>rep_mode</var> is not the next
widest integral mode and currently we take advantage of this fact.)

      <p>Similarly to <code>LOAD_EXTEND_OP</code> you may return a non-<code>UNKNOWN</code>
value even if the extension is not performed on certain hard registers
as long as for the <code>REGNO_REG_CLASS</code> of these hard registers
<code>CANNOT_CHANGE_MODE_CLASS</code> returns nonzero.

      <p>Note that <code>TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED</code> and <code>LOAD_EXTEND_OP</code>
describe two related properties.  If you define
<code>TARGET_MODE_REP_EXTENDED (mode, word_mode)</code> you probably also want
to define <code>LOAD_EXTEND_OP (mode)</code> to return the same type of
extension.

      <p>In order to enforce the representation of <code>mode</code>,
<code>TRULY_NOOP_TRUNCATION</code> should return false when truncating to
<code>mode</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: <b>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</b><var><a name="index-STORE_005fFLAG_005fVALUE-4908"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>A C expression describing the value returned by a comparison operator
with an integral mode and stored by a store-flag instruction
(`<samp><span class="samp">cstore</span><var>mode</var><span class="samp">4</span></samp>') when the condition is true.  This description must
apply to <em>all</em> the `<samp><span class="samp">cstore</span><var>mode</var><span class="samp">4</span></samp>' patterns and all the
comparison operators whose results have a <code>MODE_INT</code> mode.

      <p>A value of 1 or &minus;1 means that the instruction implementing the
comparison operator returns exactly 1 or &minus;1 when the comparison is true
and 0 when the comparison is false.  Otherwise, the value indicates
which bits of the result are guaranteed to be 1 when the comparison is
true.  This value is interpreted in the mode of the comparison
operation, which is given by the mode of the first operand in the
`<samp><span class="samp">cstore</span><var>mode</var><span class="samp">4</span></samp>' pattern.  Either the low bit or the sign bit of
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> be on.  Presently, only those bits are used by
the compiler.

      <p>If <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> is neither 1 or &minus;1, the compiler will
generate code that depends only on the specified bits.  It can also
replace comparison operators with equivalent operations if they cause
the required bits to be set, even if the remaining bits are undefined. 
For example, on a machine whose comparison operators return an
<code>SImode</code> value and where <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> is defined as
`<samp><span class="samp">0x80000000</span></samp>', saying that just the sign bit is relevant, the
expression

     <pre class="smallexample">          (ne:SI (and:SI <var>x</var> (const_int <var>power-of-2</var>)) (const_int 0))
     </pre>
      <p class="noindent">can be converted to

     <pre class="smallexample">          (ashift:SI <var>x</var> (const_int <var>n</var>))
     </pre>
      <p class="noindent">where <var>n</var> is the appropriate shift count to move the bit being
tested into the sign bit.

      <p>There is no way to describe a machine that always sets the low-order bit
for a true value, but does not guarantee the value of any other bits,
but we do not know of any machine that has such an instruction.  If you
are trying to port GCC to such a machine, include an instruction to
perform a logical-and of the result with 1 in the pattern for the
comparison operators and let us know at <a href="mailto:gcc@gcc.gnu.org">gcc@gcc.gnu.org</a>.

      <p>Often, a machine will have multiple instructions that obtain a value
from a comparison (or the condition codes).  Here are rules to guide the
choice of value for <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code>, and hence the instructions
to be used:

          <ul>
<li>Use the shortest sequence that yields a valid definition for
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code>.  It is more efficient for the compiler to
&ldquo;normalize&rdquo; the value (convert it to, e.g., 1 or 0) than for the
comparison operators to do so because there may be opportunities to
combine the normalization with other operations.

          <li>For equal-length sequences, use a value of 1 or &minus;1, with &minus;1 being
slightly preferred on machines with expensive jumps and 1 preferred on
other machines.

          <li>As a second choice, choose a value of `<samp><span class="samp">0x80000001</span></samp>' if instructions
exist that set both the sign and low-order bits but do not define the
others.

          <li>Otherwise, use a value of `<samp><span class="samp">0x80000000</span></samp>'. 
</ul>

      <p>Many machines can produce both the value chosen for
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> and its negation in the same number of
instructions.  On those machines, you should also define a pattern for
those cases, e.g., one matching

     <pre class="smallexample">          (set <var>A</var> (neg:<var>m</var> (ne:<var>m</var> <var>B</var> <var>C</var>)))
     </pre>
      <p>Some machines can also perform <code>and</code> or <code>plus</code> operations on
condition code values with less instructions than the corresponding
`<samp><span class="samp">cstore</span><var>mode</var><span class="samp">4</span></samp>' insn followed by <code>and</code> or <code>plus</code>.  On those
machines, define the appropriate patterns.  Use the names <code>incscc</code>
and <code>decscc</code>, respectively, for the patterns which perform
<code>plus</code> or <code>minus</code> operations on condition code values.  See
<samp><span class="file">rs6000.md</span></samp> for some examples.  The GNU Superoptimizer can be used to
find such instruction sequences on other machines.

      <p>If this macro is not defined, the default value, 1, is used.  You need
not define <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> if the machine has no store-flag
instructions, or if the value generated by these instructions is 1.

<blockquote><p>A C expression that indicates whether the architecture defines a value

A result of <code>0</code> indicates the value is undefined. 
If the value is defined for only the RTL expression, the macro should
evaluate to <code>1</code>; if the value applies also to the corresponding optab
entry (which is normally the case if it expands directly into
the corresponding RTL), then the macro should evaluate to <code>2</code>. 
In the cases where the value is defined, <var>value</var> should be set to

If defined, it is a C expression which makes a series of calls to

<blockquote>
<p>Each call to <code>c_register_pragma</code> or
<code>c_register_pragma_with_expansion</code> establishes one pragma.  The
<var>callback</var> routine will be called when the preprocessor encounters a
pragma of the form

     <pre class="smallexample">          #pragma [<var>space</var>] <var>name</var> ...
     </pre>
      <p><var>space</var> is the case-sensitive namespace of the pragma, or
<code>NULL</code> to put the pragma in the global namespace.  The callback
routine receives <var>pfile</var> as its first argument, which can be passed
on to cpplib's functions if necessary.  You can lex tokens after the
<var>name</var> by calling <code>pragma_lex</code>.  Tokens that are not read by the
callback will be silently ignored.  The end of the line is indicated by
a token of type <code>CPP_EOF</code>.  Macro expansion occurs on the
arguments of pragmas registered with
<code>c_register_pragma_with_expansion</code> but not on the arguments of
pragmas registered with <code>c_register_pragma</code>.

      <p>Note that the use of <code>pragma_lex</code> is specific to the C and C++
compilers.  It will not work in the Java or Fortran compilers, or any
other language compilers for that matter.  Thus if <code>pragma_lex</code> is going
to be called from target-specific code, it must only be done so when
building the C and C++ compilers.  This can be done by defining the
variables <code>c_target_objs</code> and <code>cxx_target_objs</code> in the
target entry in the <samp><span class="file">config.gcc</span></samp> file.  These variables should name
the target-specific, language-specific object file which contains the
code that uses <code>pragma_lex</code>.  Note it will also be necessary to add a
rule to the makefile fragment pointed to by <code>tmake_file</code> that shows
how to build this object file.

cannot safely move arguments from the registers in which they are passed

<blockquote><p>On some architectures it can take multiple instructions to synthesize
a constant.  If there is another constant already in a register that
is close enough in value then it is preferable that the new constant
is computed from this register using immediate addition or
subtraction.  We accomplish this through CSE.  Besides the value of
the constant we also add a lower and an upper constant anchor to the
available expressions.  These are then queried when encountering new
constants.  The anchors are computed by rounding the constant up and
down to a multiple of the value of <code>TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR</code>. 
<code>TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR</code> should be the maximum positive value
accepted by immediate-add plus one.  We currently assume that the
value of <code>TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR</code> is a power of 2.  For example, on
MIPS, where add-immediate takes a 16-bit signed value,
<code>TARGET_CONST_ANCHOR</code> is set to `<samp><span class="samp">0x8000</span></samp>'.  The default value
is zero, which disables this optimization.

<blockquote>
<p>On older ports, large integers are stored in <code>CONST_DOUBLE</code> rtl
objects.  Newer ports define <code>TARGET_SUPPORTS_WIDE_INT</code> to be nonzero
to indicate that large integers are stored in
<code>CONST_WIDE_INT</code> rtl objects.  The <code>CONST_WIDE_INT</code> allows
very large integer constants to be represented.  <code>CONST_DOUBLE</code>
is limited to twice the size of the host's <code>HOST_WIDE_INT</code>
representation.

      <p>Converting a port mostly requires looking for the places where
<code>CONST_DOUBLE</code>s are used with <code>VOIDmode</code> and replacing that
code with code that accesses <code>CONST_WIDE_INT</code>s.  `<samp><span class="samp">"grep -i
const_double"</span></samp>' at the port level gets you to 95% of the changes that
need to be made.  There are a few places that require a deeper look.

          <ul>
<li>There is no equivalent to <code>hval</code> and <code>lval</code> for
<code>CONST_WIDE_INT</code>s.  This would be difficult to express in the md
language since there are a variable number of elements.

          <p>Most ports only check that <code>hval</code> is either 0 or -1 to see if the
value is small.  As mentioned above, this will no longer be necessary
since small constants are always <code>CONST_INT</code>.  Of course there
are still a few exceptions, the alpha's constraint used by the zap
instruction certainly requires careful examination by C code. 
However, all the current code does is pass the hval and lval to C
code, so evolving the c code to look at the <code>CONST_WIDE_INT</code> is
not really a large change.

          <li>Because there is no standard template that ports use to materialize
constants, there is likely to be some futzing that is unique to each
port in this code.

          <li>The rtx costs may have to be adjusted to properly account for larger
constants that are represented as <code>CONST_WIDE_INT</code>. 
</ul>

      <p>All and all it does not take long to convert ports that the
maintainer is familiar with.
