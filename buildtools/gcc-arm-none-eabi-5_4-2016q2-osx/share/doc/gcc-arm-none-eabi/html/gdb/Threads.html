<h3 class="section">4.10 Debugging Programs with Multiple Threads</h3>

<p><a name="index-threads-of-execution-162"></a><a name="index-multiple-threads-163"></a><a name="index-switching-threads-164"></a>In some operating systems, such as HP-UX and Solaris, a single program
may have more than one <dfn>thread</dfn> of execution.  The precise semantics
of threads differ from one operating system to another, but in general
the threads of a single program are akin to multiple processes&mdash;except
that they share one address space (that is, they can all examine and
modify the same variables).  On the other hand, each thread has its own
registers and execution stack, and perhaps private memory.

   <p><span class="sc">gdb</span> provides these facilities for debugging multi-thread
programs:

     <ul>
<li>automatic notification of new threads
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">thread </span><var>threadno</var></samp>', a command to switch among threads
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>', a command to inquire about existing threads
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">thread apply [</span><var>threadno</var><span class="samp">] [</span><var>all</var><span class="samp">] </span><var>args</var></samp>',
a command to apply a command to a list of threads
<li>thread-specific breakpoints
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">set print thread-events</span></samp>', which controls printing of
messages on thread start and exit. 
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">set libthread-db-search-path </span><var>path</var></samp>', which lets
the user specify which <code>libthread_db</code> to use if the default choice
isn't compatible with the program. 
</ul>

   <blockquote>
<em>Warning:</em> These facilities are not yet available on every
<span class="sc">gdb</span> configuration where the operating system supports threads. 
If your <span class="sc">gdb</span> does not support threads, these commands have no
effect.  For example, a system without thread support shows no output
from `<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>', and always rejects the <code>thread</code> command,
like this:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) info threads
          (gdb) thread 1
          Thread ID 1 not known.  Use the "info threads" command to
          see the IDs of currently known threads.
     </pre>
        <!-- FIXME to implementors: how hard would it be to say "sorry, this GDB -->
<!-- doesn't support threads"? -->
</blockquote>

   <p><a name="index-focus-of-debugging-165"></a><a name="index-current-thread-166"></a>The <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread debugging facility allows you to observe all
threads while your program runs&mdash;but whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> takes
control, one thread in particular is always the focus of debugging. 
This thread is called the <dfn>current thread</dfn>.  Debugging commands show
program information from the perspective of the current thread.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bNew_007d-_0040var_007bsystag_007d-message-167"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028system_0029-168"></a><!-- FIXME-implementors!! It would be more helpful if the [New...] message -->
<!-- included GDB's numeric thread handle, so you could just go to that -->
<!-- thread without first checking `info threads'. -->
Whenever <span class="sc">gdb</span> detects a new thread in your program, it displays
the target system's identification for the thread with a message in the
form `<samp><span class="samp">[New </span><var>systag</var><span class="samp">]</span></samp>', where <var>systag</var> is a thread identifier
whose form varies depending on the particular system.  For example, on
<span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, you might see

<pre class="smallexample">     [New Thread 0x41e02940 (LWP 25582)]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">when <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices a new thread.  In contrast, on an SGI system,
the <var>systag</var> is simply something like `<samp><span class="samp">process 368</span></samp>', with no
further qualifier.

<!-- FIXME!! (1) Does the [New...] message appear even for the very first -->
<!-- thread of a program, or does it only appear for the -->
<!-- second-i.e.@: when it becomes obvious we have a multithread -->
<!-- program? -->
<!-- (2) *Is* there necessarily a first thread always?  Or do some -->
<!-- multithread systems permit starting a program with multiple -->
<!-- threads ab initio? -->
<p><a name="index-thread-number-169"></a><a name="index-thread-identifier-_0028GDB_0029-170"></a>For debugging purposes, <span class="sc">gdb</span> associates its own thread
number&mdash;always a single integer&mdash;with each thread in your program.

     
<a name="index-info-threads-171"></a>
<dl><dt><code>info threads </code><span class="roman">[</span><var>id</var><code>...</code><span class="roman">]</span><dd>Display a summary of all threads currently in your program.  Optional
argument <var>id</var><small class="dots">...</small> is one or more thread ids separated by spaces, and
means to print information only about the specified thread or threads. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> displays for each thread (in this order):

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>the thread number assigned by <span class="sc">gdb</span>

          <li>the target system's thread identifier (<var>systag</var>)

          <li>the thread's name, if one is known.  A thread can either be named by
the user (see <code>thread name</code>, below), or, in some cases, by the
program itself.

          <li>the current stack frame summary for that thread
          </ol>

     <p class="noindent">An asterisk `<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>' to the left of the <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread number
indicates the current thread.

     <p>For example,
</dl>
   <!-- end table here to get a little more width for example -->

<pre class="smallexample">     (gdb) info threads
       Id   Target Id         Frame
       3    process 35 thread 27  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
       2    process 35 thread 23  0x34e5 in sigpause ()
     * 1    process 35 thread 13  main (argc=1, argv=0x7ffffff8)
         at threadtest.c:68
</pre>
   <p>On Solaris, you can display more information about user threads with a
Solaris-specific command:

     <dl>
<dt><code>maint info sol-threads</code><dd><a name="index-maint-info-sol_002dthreads-172"></a><a name="index-thread-info-_0028Solaris_0029-173"></a>Display info on Solaris user threads. 
</dl>

     
<a name="index-thread-_0040var_007bthreadno_007d-174"></a>
<dl><dt><code>thread </code><var>threadno</var><dd>Make thread number <var>threadno</var> the current thread.  The command
argument <var>threadno</var> is the internal <span class="sc">gdb</span> thread number, as
shown in the first field of the `<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>' display. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> responds by displaying the system identifier of the thread
you selected, and its current stack frame summary:

     <pre class="smallexample">          (gdb) thread 2
          [Switching to thread 2 (Thread 0xb7fdab70 (LWP 12747))]
          #0  some_function (ignore=0x0) at example.c:8
          8	    printf ("hello\n");
     </pre>
     <p class="noindent">As with the `<samp><span class="samp">[New ...]</span></samp>' message, the form of the text after
`<samp><span class="samp">Switching to</span></samp>' depends on your system's conventions for identifying
threads.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0024_005fthread_0040r_007b_002c-convenience-variable_007d-175"></a>The debugger convenience variable `<samp><span class="samp">$_thread</span></samp>' contains the number
of the current thread.  You may find this useful in writing breakpoint
conditional expressions, command scripts, and so forth.  See
See <a href="Convenience-Vars.html#Convenience-Vars">Convenience Variables</a>, for general
information on convenience variables.

     <p><a name="index-thread-apply-176"></a><a name="index-apply-command-to-several-threads-177"></a><br><dt><code>thread apply [</code><var>threadno</var><code> | all [-ascending]] </code><var>command</var><dd>The <code>thread apply</code> command allows you to apply the named
<var>command</var> to one or more threads.  Specify the numbers of the
threads that you want affected with the command argument
<var>threadno</var>.  It can be a single thread number, one of the numbers
shown in the first field of the `<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>' display; or it
could be a range of thread numbers, as in <code>2-4</code>.  To apply
a command to all threads in descending order, type <kbd>thread apply all
</kbd><var>command</var>.  To apply a command to all threads in ascending order,
type <kbd>thread apply all -ascending </kbd><var>command</var>.

     <p><a name="index-thread-name-178"></a><a name="index-name-a-thread-179"></a><br><dt><code>thread name [</code><var>name</var><code>]</code><dd>This command assigns a name to the current thread.  If no argument is
given, any existing user-specified name is removed.  The thread name
appears in the `<samp><span class="samp">info threads</span></samp>' display.

     <p>On some systems, such as <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, <span class="sc">gdb</span> is able to
determine the name of the thread as given by the OS.  On these
systems, a name specified with `<samp><span class="samp">thread name</span></samp>' will override the
system-give name, and removing the user-specified name will cause
<span class="sc">gdb</span> to once again display the system-specified name.

     <p><a name="index-thread-find-180"></a><a name="index-search-for-a-thread-181"></a><br><dt><code>thread find [</code><var>regexp</var><code>]</code><dd>Search for and display thread ids whose name or <var>systag</var>
matches the supplied regular expression.

     <p>As well as being the complement to the `<samp><span class="samp">thread name</span></samp>' command,
this command also allows you to identify a thread by its target
<var>systag</var>.  For instance, on <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux, the target <var>systag</var>
is the LWP id.

     <pre class="smallexample">          (<span class="sc">gdb</span>) thread find 26688

disable printing of messages when <span class="sc">gdb</span> notices that new threads have
started or that threads have exited.  By default, these messages will
be printed if detection of these events is supported by the target. 
Note that these messages cannot be disabled on all targets.

If you omit <var>path</var>, `<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>' will be reset to
its default value (<code>$sdir:$pdir</code> on <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux and Solaris systems). 
Internally, the default value comes from the <code>LIBTHREAD_DB_SEARCH_PATH</code>
macro.

     <p>On <span class="sc">gnu</span>/Linux and Solaris systems, <span class="sc">gdb</span> uses a &ldquo;helper&rdquo;
<code>libthread_db</code> library to obtain information about threads in the
inferior process.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> will use `<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>'
to find <code>libthread_db</code>.  <span class="sc">gdb</span> also consults first if inferior
specific thread debugging library loading is enabled
by `<samp><span class="samp">set auto-load libthread-db</span></samp>' (see <a href="libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file.html#libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file">libthread_db.so.1 file</a>).

     <p>A special entry `<samp><span class="samp">$sdir</span></samp>' for `<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>'
refers to the default system directories that are
normally searched for loading shared libraries.  The `<samp><span class="samp">$sdir</span></samp>' entry
is the only kind not needing to be enabled by `<samp><span class="samp">set auto-load libthread-db</span></samp>'
(see <a href="libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file.html#libthread_005fdb_002eso_002e1-file">libthread_db.so.1 file</a>).

     <p>A special entry `<samp><span class="samp">$pdir</span></samp>' for `<samp><span class="samp">libthread-db-search-path</span></samp>'
refers to the directory from which <code>libpthread</code>
was loaded in the inferior process.

     <p>For any <code>libthread_db</code> library <span class="sc">gdb</span> finds in above directories,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> attempts to initialize it with the current inferior process. 
If this initialization fails (which could happen because of a version
mismatch between <code>libthread_db</code> and <code>libpthread</code>), <span class="sc">gdb</span>
will unload <code>libthread_db</code>, and continue with the next directory. 
If none of <code>libthread_db</code> libraries initialize successfully,
<span class="sc">gdb</span> will issue a warning and thread debugging will be disabled.

     <p>Setting <code>libthread-db-search-path</code> is currently implemented
only on some platforms.
