<h3 class="section">9.4 Pass manager</h3>

<p>The pass manager is located in <samp><span class="file">passes.c</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">tree-optimize.c</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="file">tree-pass.h</span></samp>. 
It processes passes as described in <samp><span class="file">passes.def</span></samp>. 
Its job is to run all of the individual passes in the correct order,
and take care of standard bookkeeping that applies to every pass.

 <p>The theory of operation is that each pass defines a structure that
represents everything we need to know about that pass&mdash;when it
should be run, how it should be run, what intermediate language
form or on-the-side data structures it needs.  We register the pass
to be run in some particular order, and the pass manager arranges
for everything to happen in the correct order.

 <p>The actuality doesn't completely live up to the theory at present. 
Command-line switches and <code>timevar_id_t</code> enumerations must still
be defined elsewhere.  The pass manager validates constraints but does
not attempt to (re-)generate data structures or lower intermediate
language form based on the requirements of the next pass.  Nevertheless,
what is present is useful, and a far sight better than nothing at all.

 <p>Each pass should have a unique name. 
Each pass may have its own dump file (for GCC debugging purposes). 
Passes with a name starting with a star do not dump anything. 
Sometimes passes are supposed to share a dump file / option name. 
To still give these unique names, you can use a prefix that is delimited
by a space from the part that is used for the dump file / option name. 
E.g. When the pass name is "ud dce", the name used for dump file/options
is "dce".

 <p>TODO: describe the global variables set up by the pass manager,
and a brief description of how a new pass should use it. 
I need to look at what info RTL passes use first<small class="enddots">....</small>
