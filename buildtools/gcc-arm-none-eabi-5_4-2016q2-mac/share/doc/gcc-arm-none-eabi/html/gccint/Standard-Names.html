<h3 class="section">16.9 Standard Pattern Names For Generation</h3>

<p><a name="index-standard-pattern-names-3377"></a><a name="index-pattern-names-3378"></a><a name="index-names_002c-pattern-3379"></a>
Here is a table of the instruction names that are meaningful in the RTL
generation pass of the compiler.  Giving one of these names to an
instruction pattern tells the RTL generation pass that it can use the
pattern to accomplish a certain task.

     
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmov_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3380"></a>
<dl><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dd>Here <var>m</var> stands for a two-letter machine mode name, in lowercase. 
This instruction pattern moves data with that machine mode from operand
1 to operand 0.  For example, `<samp><span class="samp">movsi</span></samp>' moves full-word data.

     <p>If operand 0 is a <code>subreg</code> with mode <var>m</var> of a register whose
own mode is wider than <var>m</var>, the effect of this instruction is
to store the specified value in the part of the register that corresponds
to mode <var>m</var>.  Bits outside of <var>m</var>, but which are within the
same target word as the <code>subreg</code> are undefined.  Bits which are
outside the target word are left unchanged.

     <p>This class of patterns is special in several ways.  First of all, each
of these names up to and including full word size <em>must</em> be defined,
because there is no other way to copy a datum from one place to another. 
If there are patterns accepting operands in larger modes,
`<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>' must be defined for integer modes of those sizes.

     <p>Second, these patterns are not used solely in the RTL generation pass. 
Even the reload pass can generate move insns to copy values from stack
slots into temporary registers.  When it does so, one of the operands is
a hard register and the other is an operand that can need to be reloaded
into a register.

     <p><a name="index-force_005freg-3381"></a>Therefore, when given such a pair of operands, the pattern must generate
RTL which needs no reloading and needs no temporary registers&mdash;no
registers other than the operands.  For example, if you support the
pattern with a <code>define_expand</code>, then in such a case the
<code>define_expand</code> mustn't call <code>force_reg</code> or any other such
function which might generate new pseudo registers.

     <p>This requirement exists even for subword modes on a RISC machine where
fetching those modes from memory normally requires several insns and
some temporary registers.

     <p><a name="index-change_005faddress-3382"></a>During reload a memory reference with an invalid address may be passed
as an operand.  Such an address will be replaced with a valid address
later in the reload pass.  In this case, nothing may be done with the
address except to use it as it stands.  If it is copied, it will not be
replaced with a valid address.  No attempt should be made to make such
an address into a valid address and no routine (such as
<code>change_address</code>) that will do so may be called.  Note that
<code>general_operand</code> will fail when applied to such an address.

     <p><a name="index-reload_005fin_005fprogress-3383"></a>The global variable <code>reload_in_progress</code> (which must be explicitly
declared if required) can be used to determine whether such special
handling is required.

     <p>The variety of operands that have reloads depends on the rest of the
machine description, but typically on a RISC machine these can only be
pseudo registers that did not get hard registers, while on other
machines explicit memory references will get optional reloads.

     <p>If a scratch register is required to move an object to or from memory,
it can be allocated using <code>gen_reg_rtx</code> prior to life analysis.

     <p>If there are cases which need scratch registers during or after reload,
you must provide an appropriate secondary_reload target hook.

     <p><a name="index-can_005fcreate_005fpseudo_005fp-3384"></a>The macro <code>can_create_pseudo_p</code> can be used to determine if it
is unsafe to create new pseudo registers.  If this variable is nonzero, then
it is unsafe to call <code>gen_reg_rtx</code> to allocate a new pseudo.

     <p>The constraints on a `<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>' must permit moving any hard
register to any other hard register provided that
<code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> permits mode <var>m</var> in both registers and
<code>TARGET_REGISTER_MOVE_COST</code> applied to their classes returns a value
of 2.

     <p>It is obligatory to support floating point `<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>'
instructions into and out of any registers that can hold fixed point
values, because unions and structures (which have modes <code>SImode</code> or
<code>DImode</code>) can be in those registers and they may have floating
point members.

     <p>There may also be a need to support fixed point `<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>'
instructions in and out of floating point registers.  Unfortunately, I
have forgotten why this was so, and I don't know whether it is still
true.  If <code>HARD_REGNO_MODE_OK</code> rejects fixed point values in
floating point registers, then the constraints of the fixed point
`<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>' instructions must be designed to avoid ever trying to
reload into a floating point register.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007breload_005fin_007d-instruction-pattern-3385"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007breload_005fout_007d-instruction-pattern-3386"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">reload_in</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">reload_out</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dd>These named patterns have been obsoleted by the target hook
<code>secondary_reload</code>.

     <p>Like `<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>', but used when a scratch register is required to
move between operand 0 and operand 1.  Operand 2 describes the scratch
register.  See the discussion of the <code>SECONDARY_RELOAD_CLASS</code>
macro in see <a href="Register-Classes.html#Register-Classes">Register Classes</a>.

     <p>There are special restrictions on the form of the <code>match_operand</code>s
used in these patterns.  First, only the predicate for the reload
operand is examined, i.e., <code>reload_in</code> examines operand 1, but not
the predicates for operand 0 or 2.  Second, there may be only one
alternative in the constraints.  Third, only a single register class
letter may be used for the constraint; subsequent constraint letters
are ignored.  As a special exception, an empty constraint string
matches the <code>ALL_REGS</code> register class.  This may relieve ports
of the burden of defining an <code>ALL_REGS</code> constraint letter just
for these patterns.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmovstrict_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3387"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">movstrict</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dd>Like `<samp><span class="samp">mov</span><var>m</var></samp>' except that if operand 0 is a <code>subreg</code>
with mode <var>m</var> of a register whose natural mode is wider,
the `<samp><span class="samp">movstrict</span><var>m</var></samp>' instruction is guaranteed not to alter
any of the register except the part which belongs to mode <var>m</var>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmovmisalign_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3388"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">movmisalign</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dd>This variant of a move pattern is designed to load or store a value
from a memory address that is not naturally aligned for its mode. 
For a store, the memory will be in operand 0; for a load, the memory
will be in operand 1.  The other operand is guaranteed not to be a
memory, so that it's easy to tell whether this is a load or store.

     <p>This pattern is used by the autovectorizer, and when expanding a
<code>MISALIGNED_INDIRECT_REF</code> expression.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bload_005fmultiple_007d-instruction-pattern-3389"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">load_multiple</span></samp>'<dd>Load several consecutive memory locations into consecutive registers. 
Operand 0 is the first of the consecutive registers, operand 1
is the first memory location, and operand 2 is a constant: the
number of consecutive registers.

     <p>Define this only if the target machine really has such an instruction;
do not define this if the most efficient way of loading consecutive
registers from memory is to do them one at a time.

     <p>On some machines, there are restrictions as to which consecutive
registers can be stored into memory, such as particular starting or
ending register numbers or only a range of valid counts.  For those
machines, use a <code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="Expander-Definitions.html#Expander-Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>)
and make the pattern fail if the restrictions are not met.

     <p>Write the generated insn as a <code>parallel</code> with elements being a
<code>set</code> of one register from the appropriate memory location (you may
also need <code>use</code> or <code>clobber</code> elements).  Use a
<code>match_parallel</code> (see <a href="RTL-Template.html#RTL-Template">RTL Template</a>) to recognize the insn.  See
<samp><span class="file">rs6000.md</span></samp> for examples of the use of this insn pattern.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040samp_007bstore_005fmultiple_007d-instruction-pattern-3390"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">store_multiple</span></samp>'<dd>Similar to `<samp><span class="samp">load_multiple</span></samp>', but store several consecutive registers
into consecutive memory locations.  Operand 0 is the first of the
consecutive memory locations, operand 1 is the first register, and
operand 2 is a constant: the number of consecutive registers.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvec_005fload_005flanes_0040var_007bm_007d_0040var_007bn_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3391"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">vec_load_lanes</span><var>m</var><var>n</var></samp>'<dd>Perform an interleaved load of several vectors from memory operand 1
into register operand 0.  Both operands have mode <var>m</var>.  The register
operand is viewed as holding consecutive vectors of mode <var>n</var>,
while the memory operand is a flat array that contains the same number
of elements.  The operation is equivalent to:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int c = GET_MODE_SIZE (<var>m</var>) / GET_MODE_SIZE (<var>n</var>);
          for (j = 0; j &lt; GET_MODE_NUNITS (<var>n</var>); j++)
            for (i = 0; i &lt; c; i++)
              operand0[i][j] = operand1[j * c + i];
     </pre>
     <p>For example, `<samp><span class="samp">vec_load_lanestiv4hi</span></samp>' loads 8 16-bit values
from memory into a register of mode `<samp><span class="samp">TI</span></samp>'.  The register
contains two consecutive vectors of mode `<samp><span class="samp">V4HI</span></samp>'.

     <p>This pattern can only be used if:
     <pre class="smallexample">          TARGET_ARRAY_MODE_SUPPORTED_P (<var>n</var>, <var>c</var>)
     </pre>
     <p>is true.  GCC assumes that, if a target supports this kind of
instruction for some mode <var>n</var>, it also supports unaligned
loads for vectors of mode <var>n</var>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvec_005fstore_005flanes_0040var_007bm_007d_0040var_007bn_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3392"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">vec_store_lanes</span><var>m</var><var>n</var></samp>'<dd>Equivalent to `<samp><span class="samp">vec_load_lanes</span><var>m</var><var>n</var></samp>', with the memory
and register operands reversed.  That is, the instruction is
equivalent to:

     <pre class="smallexample">          int c = GET_MODE_SIZE (<var>m</var>) / GET_MODE_SIZE (<var>n</var>);
          for (j = 0; j &lt; GET_MODE_NUNITS (<var>n</var>); j++)
            for (i = 0; i &lt; c; i++)
              operand0[j * c + i] = operand1[i][j];
     </pre>
     <p>for a memory operand 0 and register operand 1.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvec_005fset_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3393"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">vec_set</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dd>Set given field in the vector value.  Operand 0 is the vector to modify,
operand 1 is new value of field and operand 2 specify the field index.

and operand 1 is parallel containing values for individual fields.

receive a combination of operand 1 and operand 2, which are of mode <var>m</var>,
dependent on the outcome of the predicate in operand 3 which is a
vector comparison with operands of mode <var>n</var> in operands 4 and 5.  The
modes <var>m</var> and <var>n</var> should have the same size.  Operand 0
will be set to the value <var>op1</var> &amp; <var>msk</var> | <var>op2</var> &amp; ~<var>msk</var>
where <var>msk</var> is computed by element-wise evaluation of the vector
comparison with a truth value of all-ones and a false value of all-zeros.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvec_005fperm_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3397"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">vec_perm</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dd>Output a (variable) vector permutation.  Operand 0 is the destination
to receive elements from operand 1 and operand 2, which are of mode
<var>m</var>.  Operand 3 is the <dfn>selector</dfn>.  It is an integral mode
vector of the same width and number of elements as mode <var>m</var>.

     <p>The input elements are numbered from 0 in operand 1 through
2*<var>N</var>-1 in operand 2.  The elements of the selector must
be computed modulo 2*<var>N</var>.  Note that if
<code>rtx_equal_p(operand1, operand2)</code>, this can be implemented
with just operand 1 and selector elements modulo <var>N</var>.

     <p>In order to make things easy for a number of targets, if there is no
`<samp><span class="samp">vec_perm</span></samp>' pattern for mode <var>m</var>, but there is for mode <var>q</var>
where <var>q</var> is a vector of <code>QImode</code> of the same width as <var>m</var>,
the middle-end will lower the mode <var>m</var> <code>VEC_PERM_EXPR</code> to
mode <var>q</var>.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bvec_005fperm_005fconst_0040var_007bm_007d_007d-instruction-pattern-3398"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">vec_perm_const</span><var>m</var></samp>'<dd>Like `<samp><span class="samp">vec_perm</span></samp>' except that the permutation is a compile-time
constant.  That is, operand 3, the <dfn>selector</dfn>, is a <code>CONST_VECTOR</code>.

     <p>Some targets cannot perform a permutation with a variable selector,
but can efficiently perform a constant permutation.  Further, the
target hook <code>vec_perm_ok</code> is queried to determine if the
specific constant permutation is available efficiently; the named
pattern is never expanded without <code>vec_perm_ok</code> returning true.

     <p>There is no need for a target to supply both `<samp><span class="samp">vec_perm</span><var>m</var></samp>'
and `<samp><span class="samp">vec_perm_const</span><var>m</var></samp>' if the former can trivially implement
the operation with, say, the vector constant loaded into a register.

<code>PUSH_ROUNDING</code> is defined.  For historical reason, this pattern may be
missing and in such case an <code>mov</code> expander is used instead, with a

method is deprecated.

     <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007badd_0040var_007bm_007d3_007d-instruction-pattern-3400"></a><br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">add</span><var>m</var><span class="samp">3</span></samp>'<dd>Add operand 2 and operand 1, storing the result in operand 0.  All operands

are the first two operands, and both are <code>mem:BLK</code>s with an
address in mode <code>Pmode</code>.

     <p>The number of bytes to move is the third operand, in mode <var>m</var>. 
Usually, you specify <code>Pmode</code> for <var>m</var>.  However, if you can
generate better code knowing the range of valid lengths is smaller than
those representable in a full Pmode pointer, you should provide
a pattern with a
mode corresponding to the range of values you can handle efficiently
(e.g., <code>QImode</code> for values in the range 0&ndash;127; note we avoid numbers
that appear negative) and also a pattern with <code>Pmode</code>.

     <p>The fourth operand is the known shared alignment of the source and
destination, in the form of a <code>const_int</code> rtx.  Thus, if the
compiler knows that both source and destination are word-aligned,
it may provide the value 4 for this operand.

     <p>Optional operands 5 and 6 specify expected alignment and size of block
respectively.  The expected alignment differs from alignment in operand 4
in a way that the blocks are not required to be aligned according to it in
all cases. This expected alignment is also in bytes, just like operand 4. 
Expected size, when unknown, is set to <code>(const_int -1)</code>.

     <p>Descriptions of multiple <code>movmem</code><var>m</var> patterns can only be
beneficial if the patterns for smaller modes have fewer restrictions
on their first, second and fourth operands.  Note that the mode <var>m</var>
in <code>movmem</code><var>m</var> does not impose any restriction on the mode of
individually moved data units in the block.

     <p>These patterns need not give special consideration to the possibility
that the source and destination strings might overlap.

clearing of memory should reject any value that is not the constant 0.  See
`<samp><span class="samp">movmem</span><var>m</var></samp>' for a discussion of the choice of mode.

     <p>The fourth operand is the known alignment of the destination, in the form

destination is word-aligned, it may provide the value 4 for this
operand.

     <p>Optional operands 5 and 6 specify expected alignment and size of block
respectively.  The expected alignment differs from alignment in operand 4
in a way that the blocks are not required to be aligned according to it in
all cases. This expected alignment is also in bytes, just like operand 4. 
Expected size, when unknown, is set to <code>(const_int -1)</code>. 
Operand 7 is the minimal size of the block and operand 8 is the
maximal size of the block (NULL if it can not be represented as CONST_INT). 
Operand 9 is the probable maximal size (i.e. we can not rely on it for correctness,

You specify the mode that operand 0 must have when you write the
<code>match_operand</code> expression.  The compiler automatically sees which
mode you have used and supplies an operand of that mode.

     <p>The value stored for a true condition must have 1 as its low bit, or
else must be negative.  Otherwise the instruction is not suitable and
you should omit it from the machine description.  You describe to the
compiler exactly which value is stored by defining the macro
<code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> (see <a href="Misc.html#Misc">Misc</a>).  If a description cannot be
found that can be used for all the possible comparison operators, you
should pick one and use a <code>define_expand</code> to map all results
onto the one you chose.

     <p>These operations may <code>FAIL</code>, but should do so only in relatively
uncommon cases; if they would <code>FAIL</code> for common cases involving
integer comparisons, it is best to restrict the predicates to not
allow these operands.  Likewise if a given comparison operator will
always fail, independent of the operands (for floating-point modes, the
<code>ordered_comparison_operator</code> predicate is often useful in this case).

     <p>If this pattern is omitted, the compiler will generate a conditional
branch&mdash;for example, it may copy a constant one to the target and branching
around an assignment of zero to the target&mdash;or a libcall.  If the predicate
for operand 1 only rejects some operators, it will also try reordering the
operands and/or inverting the result value (e.g. by an exclusive OR). 
These possibilities could be cheaper or equivalent to the instructions
used for the `<samp><span class="samp">cstore</span><var>mode</var><span class="samp">4</span></samp>' pattern followed by those required
to convert a positive result from <code>STORE_FLAG_VALUE</code> to 1; in this
case, you can and should make operand 1's predicate reject some operators
in the `<samp><span class="samp">cstore</span><var>mode</var><span class="samp">4</span></samp>' pattern, or remove the pattern altogether
from the machine description.

from an object of mode <code>Pmode</code>.  Do not define these patterns on
such machines.

     <p>Some machines require special handling for stack pointer saves and
restores.  On those machines, define the patterns corresponding to the
non-standard cases by using a <code>define_expand</code> (see <a href="Expander-Definitions.html#Expander-Definitions">Expander Definitions</a>) that produces the required insns.  The three types of
saves and restores are:

          <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>`<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_block</span></samp>' saves the stack pointer at the start of a block
that allocates a variable-sized object, and `<samp><span class="samp">restore_stack_block</span></samp>'
restores the stack pointer when the block is exited.

          <li>`<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_function</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">restore_stack_function</span></samp>' do a
similar job for the outermost block of a function and are used when the
function allocates variable-sized objects or calls <code>alloca</code>.  Only
the epilogue uses the restored stack pointer, allowing a simpler save or
restore sequence on some machines.

          <li>`<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_nonlocal</span></samp>' is used in functions that contain labels
branched to by nested functions.  It saves the stack pointer in such a
way that the inner function can use `<samp><span class="samp">restore_stack_nonlocal</span></samp>' to
restore the stack pointer.  The compiler generates code to restore the
frame and argument pointer registers, but some machines require saving
and restoring additional data such as register window information or
stack backchains.  Place insns in these patterns to save and restore any
such required data.
          </ol>

     <p>When saving the stack pointer, operand 0 is the save area and operand 1
is the stack pointer.  The mode used to allocate the save area defaults
to <code>Pmode</code> but you can override that choice by defining the
<code>STACK_SAVEAREA_MODE</code> macro (see <a href="Storage-Layout.html#Storage-Layout">Storage Layout</a>).  You must
specify an integral mode, or <code>VOIDmode</code> if no save area is needed
for a particular type of save (either because no save is needed or
because a machine-specific save area can be used).  Operand 0 is the
stack pointer and operand 1 is the save area for restore operations.  If
`<samp><span class="samp">save_stack_block</span></samp>' is defined, operand 0 must not be
<code>VOIDmode</code> since these saves can be arbitrarily nested.

     <p>A save area is a <code>mem</code> that is at a constant offset from
<code>virtual_stack_vars_rtx</code> when the stack pointer is saved for use by
nonlocal gotos and a <code>reg</code> in the other two cases.

the stack pointer to create space for dynamically allocated data.

     <p>Store the resultant pointer to this space into operand 0.  If you
are allocating space from the main stack, do this by emitting a
move insn to copy <code>virtual_stack_dynamic_rtx</code> to operand 0. 
If you are allocating the space elsewhere, generate code to copy the
location of the space to operand 0.  In the latter case, you must
ensure this space gets freed when the corresponding space on the main
stack is free.

     <p>Do not define this pattern if all that must be done is the subtraction. 
Some machines require other operations such as stack probes or
maintaining the back chain.  Define this pattern to emit those
operations in addition to updating the stack pointer.

the stack farthest from the current stack pointer that you need to validate. 
Normally, on platforms where this pattern is needed, you would obtain the
stack limit from a global or thread-specific variable or register.

To this end, GCC will look for a <code>MODE_CC</code> set in the
output of <code>sync_compare_and_swap</code><var>mode</var>; if the machine
description includes such a set, the target should also define special
<code>cbranchcc4</code> and/or <code>cstorecc4</code> instructions.  GCC will then
be able to take the destination of the <code>MODE_CC</code> set and pass it
to the <code>cbranchcc4</code> or <code>cstorecc4</code> pattern as the first

set of <var>__sync</var> builtins are supported via library calls, the
target can initialize all of the optabs at once with
<code>init_sync_libfuncs</code>. 
For the purposes of C++11 <code>std::atomic::is_lock_free</code>, it is
assumed that these library calls do <em>not</em> use any kind of
interruptable locking.
