<!-- THIS SECTION IS CRAP AND NEEDS REWRITING BADLY. -->

   <p>To date, <code>libiberty</code> is generally not installed on its own.  It has evolved
over years but does not have its own version number nor release schedule.

   <p>Possibly the easiest way to use <code>libiberty</code> in your projects is to drop the
<code>libiberty</code> code into your project's sources, and to build the library along
with your own sources; the library would then be linked in at the end.  This
prevents any possible version mismatches with other copies of libiberty
elsewhere on the system.

   <p>Passing <samp><span class="option">--enable-install-libiberty</span></samp> to the <samp><span class="command">configure</span></samp>
script when building <code>libiberty</code> causes the header files and archive library
to be installed when <kbd>make install</kbd> is run.  This option also takes
an (optional) argument to specify the installation location, in the same
manner as <samp><span class="option">--prefix</span></samp>.

   <p>For your own projects, an approach which offers stability and flexibility
is to include <code>libiberty</code> with your code, but allow the end user to optionally
choose to use a previously-installed version instead.  In this way the
user may choose (for example) to install <code>libiberty</code> as part of GCC, and use
that version for all software built with that compiler.  (This approach
has proven useful with software using the GNU <code>readline</code> library.)

   <p>Making use of <code>libiberty</code> code usually requires that you include one or more
header files from the <code>libiberty</code> distribution.  (They will be named as
necessary in the function descriptions.)  At link time, you will need to
add <samp><span class="option">-liberty</span></samp> to your link command invocation.

<h2 class="chapter">2 Overview</h2>

<p>Functions contained in <code>libiberty</code> can be divided into three general categories.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#Supplemental-Functions">Supplemental Functions</a>:        Providing functions which don't exist
                                 on older operating systems.

<li><a accesskey="2" href="#Replacement-Functions">Replacement Functions</a>:         These functions are sometimes buggy or
                                 unpredictable on some operating systems.

<li><a accesskey="3" href="#Extensions">Extensions</a>:                    Functions which provide useful extensions
                                 or safety wrappers around existing code. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">2.1 Supplemental Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-supplemental-functions-4"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-supplemental-5"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-missing-6"></a>
Certain operating systems do not provide functions which have since
become standardized, or at least common.  For example, the Single
Unix Specification Version 2 requires that the <code>basename</code>
function be provided, but an OS which predates that specification
might not have this function.  This should not prevent well-written
code from running on such a system.

   <p>Similarly, some functions exist only among a particular &ldquo;flavor&rdquo;
or &ldquo;family&rdquo; of operating systems.  As an example, the <code>bzero</code>
function is often not present on systems outside the BSD-derived
family of systems.

   <p>Many such functions are provided in <code>libiberty</code>.  They are quickly
listed here with little description, as systems which lack them
become less and less common.  Each function <var>foo</var> is implemented
in <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.c</span></samp> but not declared in any <code>libiberty</code> header file; more
comments and caveats for each function's implementation are often
available in the source file.  Generally, the function can simply
be declared as <code>extern</code>.

<h3 class="section">2.2 Replacement Functions</h3>

<p><a name="index-replacement-functions-7"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-replacement-8"></a>
Some functions have extremely limited implementations on different
platforms.  Other functions are tedious to use correctly; for example,
proper use of <code>malloc</code> calls for the return value to be checked and
appropriate action taken if memory has been exhausted.  A group of
&ldquo;replacement functions&rdquo; is available in <code>libiberty</code> to address these issues
for some of the most commonly used subroutines.

   <p>All of these functions are declared in the <samp><span class="file">libiberty.h</span></samp> header
file.  Many of the implementations will use preprocessor macros set by
GNU Autoconf, if you decide to make use of that program.  Some of these
functions may call one another.

<h4 class="subsection">2.2.1 Memory Allocation</h4>

<p><a name="index-memory-allocation-9"></a>
The functions beginning with the letter `<samp><span class="samp">x</span></samp>' are wrappers around
standard functions; the functions provided by the system environment
are called and their results checked before the results are passed back
to client code.  If the standard functions fail, these wrappers will
terminate the program.  Thus, these versions can be used with impunity.

<p><a name="index-extensions-12"></a><a name="index-functions_002c-extension-13"></a>
<code>libiberty</code> includes additional functionality above and beyond standard
functions, which has proven generically useful in GNU programs, such as
obstacks and regex.  These functions are often copied from other
projects as they gain popularity, and are included here to provide a
central location from which to use, maintain, and distribute them.

<h4 class="subsection">2.3.1 Obstacks</h4>

<p><a name="index-obstacks-14"></a>
An <dfn>obstack</dfn> is a pool of memory containing a stack of objects.  You
can create any number of separate obstacks, and then allocate objects in
specified obstacks.  Within each obstack, the last object allocated must
always be the first one freed, but distinct obstacks are independent of
each other.

   <p>Aside from this one constraint of order of freeing, obstacks are totally
general: an obstack can contain any number of objects of any size.  They
are implemented with macros, so allocation is usually very fast as long as
the objects are usually small.  And the only space overhead per object is
the padding needed to start each object on a suitable boundary.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.1 Creating Obstacks</h5>

<p>The utilities for manipulating obstacks are declared in the header
file <samp><span class="file">obstack.h</span></samp>. 
<a name="index-obstack_002eh-15"></a>
<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Data Type: <b>struct obstack</b><var><a name="index-struct-obstack-16"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>An obstack is represented by a data structure of type <code>struct
obstack</code>.  This structure has a small fixed size; it records the status
of the obstack and how to find the space in which objects are allocated. 
It does not contain any of the objects themselves.  You should not try
to access the contents of the structure directly; use only the functions
described in this chapter. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>You can declare variables of type <code>struct obstack</code> and use them as
obstacks, or you can allocate obstacks dynamically like any other kind
of object.  Dynamic allocation of obstacks allows your program to have a
variable number of different stacks.  (You can even allocate an
obstack structure in another obstack, but this is rarely useful.)

   <p>All the functions that work with obstacks require you to specify which
obstack to use.  You do this with a pointer of type <code>struct obstack
*</code>.  In the following, we often say &ldquo;an obstack&rdquo; when strictly
speaking the object at hand is such a pointer.

   <p>The objects in the obstack are packed into large blocks called
<dfn>chunks</dfn>.  The <code>struct obstack</code> structure points to a chain of
the chunks currently in use.

   <p>The obstack library obtains a new chunk whenever you allocate an object
that won't fit in the previous chunk.  Since the obstack library manages
chunks automatically, you don't need to pay much attention to them, but
you do need to supply a function which the obstack library should use to
get a chunk.  Usually you supply a function which uses <code>malloc</code>
directly or indirectly.  You must also supply a function to free a chunk. 
These matters are described in the following section.

<div class="node">
<p><hr>
<a name="Preparing-for-Obstacks"></a>

Previous:&nbsp;<a rel="previous" accesskey="p" href="#Creating-Obstacks">Creating Obstacks</a>,
Up:&nbsp;<a rel="up" accesskey="u" href="#Obstacks">Obstacks</a>

</div>

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.2 Preparing for Using Obstacks</h5>

<p>Each source file in which you plan to use the obstack functions
must include the header file <samp><span class="file">obstack.h</span></samp>, like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     #include &lt;obstack.h&gt;
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-obstack_005fchunk_005falloc-17"></a><a name="index-obstack_005fchunk_005ffree-18"></a>Also, if the source file uses the macro <code>obstack_init</code>, it must
declare or define two functions or macros that will be called by the
obstack library.  One, <code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code>, is used to allocate
the chunks of memory into which objects are packed.  The other,
<code>obstack_chunk_free</code>, is used to return chunks when the objects in
them are freed.  These macros should appear before any use of obstacks
in the source file.

   <p>Usually these are defined to use <code>malloc</code> via the intermediary
<code>xmalloc</code> (see <a href="libc.html#Unconstrained-Allocation">Unconstrained Allocation</a>).  This is done with
the following pair of macro definitions:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define obstack_chunk_alloc xmalloc
     #define obstack_chunk_free free
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Though the memory you get using obstacks really comes from <code>malloc</code>,
using obstacks is faster because <code>malloc</code> is called less often, for
larger blocks of memory.  See <a href="#Obstack-Chunks">Obstack Chunks</a>, for full details.

   <p>At run time, before the program can use a <code>struct obstack</code> object
as an obstack, it must initialize the obstack by calling
<code>obstack_init</code>.

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>obstack_init</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005finit-19"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Initialize obstack <var>obstack-ptr</var> for allocation of objects.  This
function calls the obstack's <code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code> function.  If
allocation of memory fails, the function pointed to by
<code>obstack_alloc_failed_handler</code> is called.  The <code>obstack_init</code>
function always returns 1 (Compatibility notice: Former versions of
obstack returned 0 if allocation failed). 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Here are two examples of how to allocate the space for an obstack and
initialize it.  First, an obstack that is a static variable:

<pre class="smallexample">     static struct obstack myobstack;
     ...
     obstack_init (&amp;myobstack);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Second, an obstack that is itself dynamically allocated:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct obstack *myobstack_ptr
       = (struct obstack *) xmalloc (sizeof (struct obstack));
     
     obstack_init (myobstack_ptr);
</pre>
   <!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>obstack_alloc_failed_handler</b><var><a name="index-obstack_005falloc_005ffailed_005fhandler-20"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value of this variable is a pointer to a function that
<code>obstack</code> uses when <code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code> fails to allocate
memory.  The default action is to print a message and abort. 
You should supply a function that either calls <code>exit</code>
(see <a href="libc.html#Program-Termination">Program Termination</a>) or <code>longjmp</code> (see <a href="libc.html#Non_002dLocal-Exits">Non-Local Exits</a>) and doesn't return.

     <pre class="smallexample">          void my_obstack_alloc_failed (void)
          ...
          obstack_alloc_failed_handler = &amp;my_obstack_alloc_failed;

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.3 Allocation in an Obstack</h5>

<p><a name="index-allocation-_0028obstacks_0029-21"></a>
The most direct way to allocate an object in an obstack is with
<code>obstack_alloc</code>, which is invoked almost like <code>malloc</code>.

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void * <b>obstack_alloc</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr, int size</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005falloc-22"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This allocates an uninitialized block of <var>size</var> bytes in an obstack
and returns its address.  Here <var>obstack-ptr</var> specifies which obstack
to allocate the block in; it is the address of the <code>struct obstack</code>
object which represents the obstack.  Each obstack function or macro
requires you to specify an <var>obstack-ptr</var> as the first argument.

        <p>This function calls the obstack's <code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code> function if
it needs to allocate a new chunk of memory; it calls
<code>obstack_alloc_failed_handler</code> if allocation of memory by
<code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code> failed. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>For example, here is a function that allocates a copy of a string <var>str</var>
in a specific obstack, which is in the variable <code>string_obstack</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">     struct obstack string_obstack;
     
     char *
     copystring (char *string)
     {
       size_t len = strlen (string) + 1;
       char *s = (char *) obstack_alloc (&amp;string_obstack, len);
       memcpy (s, string, len);
       return s;
     }
</pre>
   <p>To allocate a block with specified contents, use the function
<code>obstack_copy</code>, declared like this:

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void * <b>obstack_copy</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr, void *address, int size</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005fcopy-23"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>This allocates a block and initializes it by copying <var>size</var>
bytes of data starting at <var>address</var>.  It calls
<code>obstack_alloc_failed_handler</code> if allocation of memory by
<code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code> failed. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void * <b>obstack_copy0</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr, void *address, int size</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005fcopy0-24"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Like <code>obstack_copy</code>, but appends an extra byte containing a null

   <p>The <code>obstack_copy0</code> function is convenient for copying a sequence
of characters into an obstack as a null-terminated string.  Here is an
example of its use:

     obstack_savestring (char *addr, int size)
     {
       return obstack_copy0 (&amp;myobstack, addr, size);

<code>malloc</code> (see <a href="libc.html#Basic-Allocation">Basic Allocation</a>).

<p><a name="index-freeing-_0028obstacks_0029-25"></a>
To free an object allocated in an obstack, use the function
<code>obstack_free</code>.  Since the obstack is a stack of objects, freeing
one object automatically frees all other objects allocated more recently
in the same obstack.

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: void <b>obstack_free</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr, void *object</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005ffree-26"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If <var>object</var> is a null pointer, everything allocated in the obstack
is freed.  Otherwise, <var>object</var> must be the address of an object
allocated in the obstack.  Then <var>object</var> is freed, along with
everything allocated in <var>obstack</var> since <var>object</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Note that if <var>object</var> is a null pointer, the result is an
uninitialized obstack.  To free all memory in an obstack but leave it
valid for further allocation, call <code>obstack_free</code> with the address
of the first object allocated on the obstack:

<pre class="smallexample">     obstack_free (obstack_ptr, first_object_allocated_ptr);
</pre>
   <p>Recall that the objects in an obstack are grouped into chunks.  When all
the objects in a chunk become free, the obstack library automatically
frees the chunk (see <a href="#Preparing-for-Obstacks">Preparing for Obstacks</a>).  Then other
obstacks, or non-obstack allocation, can reuse the space of the chunk.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.5 Obstack Functions and Macros</h5>

<p><a name="index-macros-27"></a>
The interfaces for using obstacks may be defined either as functions or
as macros, depending on the compiler.  The obstack facility works with
all C compilers, including both ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> and traditional C, but there are
precautions you must take if you plan to use compilers other than GNU C.

   <p>If you are using an old-fashioned non-ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> compiler, all the obstack
&ldquo;functions&rdquo; are actually defined only as macros.  You can call these
macros like functions, but you cannot use them in any other way (for
example, you cannot take their address).

   <p>Calling the macros requires a special precaution: namely, the first
operand (the obstack pointer) may not contain any side effects, because
it may be computed more than once.  For example, if you write this:

<pre class="smallexample">     obstack_alloc (get_obstack (), 4);
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">you will find that <code>get_obstack</code> may be called several times. 
If you use <code>*obstack_list_ptr++</code> as the obstack pointer argument,
you will get very strange results since the incrementation may occur
several times.

   <p>In ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w -->, each function has both a macro definition and a function
definition.  The function definition is used if you take the address of the
function without calling it.  An ordinary call uses the macro definition by
default, but you can request the function definition instead by writing the
function name in parentheses, as shown here:

<pre class="smallexample">     char *x;
     void *(*funcp) ();
     /* <span class="roman">Use the macro</span>.  */
     x = (char *) obstack_alloc (obptr, size);
     /* <span class="roman">Call the function</span>.  */
     x = (char *) (obstack_alloc) (obptr, size);
     /* <span class="roman">Take the address of the function</span>.  */
     funcp = obstack_alloc;
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This is the same situation that exists in ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w --> for the standard library
functions.  See <a href="libc.html#Macro-Definitions">Macro Definitions</a>.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong> When you do use the macros, you must observe the
precaution of avoiding side effects in the first operand, even in ISO&nbsp;C<!-- /@w -->.

   <p>If you use the GNU C compiler, this precaution is not necessary, because
various language extensions in GNU C permit defining the macros so as to
compute each argument only once.

Because memory in obstack chunks is used sequentially, it is possible to
build up an object step by step, adding one or more bytes at a time to the
end of the object.  With this technique, you do not need to know how much
data you will put in the object until you come to the end of it.  We call
this the technique of <dfn>growing objects</dfn>.  The special functions
for adding data to the growing object are described in this section.

   <p>You don't need to do anything special when you start to grow an object. 
Using one of the functions to add data to the object automatically
starts it.  However, it is necessary to say explicitly when the object is
finished.  This is done with the function <code>obstack_finish</code>.

   <p>The actual address of the object thus built up is not known until the
object is finished.  Until then, it always remains possible that you will
add so much data that the object must be copied into a new chunk.

   <p>While the obstack is in use for a growing object, you cannot use it for
ordinary allocation of another object.  If you try to do so, the space
already added to the growing object will become part of the other object.

<p><a name="index-efficiency-and-obstacks-39"></a>
The usual functions for growing objects incur overhead for checking
whether there is room for the new growth in the current chunk.  If you
are frequently constructing objects in small steps of growth, this
overhead can be significant.

   <p>You can reduce the overhead by using special &ldquo;fast growth&rdquo;
functions that grow the object without checking.  In order to have a
robust program, you must do the checking yourself.  If you do this checking
in the simplest way each time you are about to add data to the object, you
have not saved anything, because that is what the ordinary growth
functions do.  But if you can arrange to check less often, or check
more efficiently, then you make the program faster.

   <p>The function <code>obstack_room</code> returns the amount of room available
in the current chunk.  It is declared as follows:

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: int <b>obstack_room</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005froom-40"></a></var><br>

for adding data to a growing object:

</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>When you check for space using <code>obstack_room</code> and there is not
enough room for what you want to add, the fast growth functions
are not safe.  In this case, simply use the corresponding ordinary
growth function instead.  Very soon this will copy the object to a
new chunk; then there will be lots of room available again.

   <p>So, each time you use an ordinary growth function, check afterward for
sufficient space using <code>obstack_room</code>.  Once the object is copied
to a new chunk, there will be plenty of space again, so the program will
start using the fast growth functions again.

   <p>Here is an example:

     add_string (struct obstack *obstack, const char *ptr, int len)

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.9 Alignment of Data in Obstacks</h5>

<p><a name="index-alignment-_0028in-obstacks_0029-50"></a>
Each obstack has an <dfn>alignment boundary</dfn>; each object allocated in
the obstack automatically starts on an address that is a multiple of the
specified boundary.  By default, this boundary is aligned so that
the object can hold any type of data.

   <p>To access an obstack's alignment boundary, use the macro
<code>obstack_alignment_mask</code>, whose function prototype looks like
this:

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">
&mdash; Macro: int <b>obstack_alignment_mask</b> (<var>struct obstack *obstack-ptr</var>)<var><a name="index-obstack_005falignment_005fmask-51"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>The value is a bit mask; a bit that is 1 indicates that the corresponding
bit in the address of an object should be 0.  The mask value should be one
less than a power of 2; the effect is that all object addresses are
multiples of that power of 2.  The default value of the mask is a value
that allows aligned objects to hold any type of data: for example, if
its value is 3, any type of data can be stored at locations whose
addresses are multiples of 4.  A mask value of 0 means an object can start
on any multiple of 1 (that is, no alignment is required).

        <p>The expansion of the macro <code>obstack_alignment_mask</code> is an lvalue,
so you can alter the mask by assignment.  For example, this statement:

     <pre class="smallexample">          obstack_alignment_mask (obstack_ptr) = 0;
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">has the effect of turning off alignment processing in the specified obstack. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Note that a change in alignment mask does not take effect until
<em>after</em> the next time an object is allocated or finished in the
obstack.  If you are not growing an object, you can make the new
alignment mask take effect immediately by calling <code>obstack_finish</code>. 
This will finish a zero-length object and then do proper alignment for
the next object.

<h5 class="subsubsection">2.3.1.10 Obstack Chunks</h5>

<p><a name="index-efficiency-of-chunks-52"></a><a name="index-chunks-53"></a>
Obstacks work by allocating space for themselves in large chunks, and
then parceling out space in the chunks to satisfy your requests.  Chunks
are normally 4096 bytes long unless you specify a different chunk size. 
The chunk size includes 8 bytes of overhead that are not actually used
for storing objects.  Regardless of the specified size, longer chunks
will be allocated when necessary for long objects.

   <p>The obstack library allocates chunks by calling the function
<code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code>, which you must define.  When a chunk is no
longer needed because you have freed all the objects in it, the obstack
library frees the chunk by calling <code>obstack_chunk_free</code>, which you
must also define.

   <p>These two must be defined (as macros) or declared (as functions) in each
source file that uses <code>obstack_init</code> (see <a href="#Creating-Obstacks">Creating Obstacks</a>). 
Most often they are defined as macros like this:

<pre class="smallexample">     #define obstack_chunk_alloc malloc
     #define obstack_chunk_free free
</pre>
   <p>Note that these are simple macros (no arguments).  Macro definitions with
arguments will not work!  It is necessary that <code>obstack_chunk_alloc</code>
or <code>obstack_chunk_free</code>, alone, expand into a function name if it is
not itself a function name.

   <p>If you allocate chunks with <code>malloc</code>, the chunk size should be a
power of 2.  The default chunk size, 4096, was chosen because it is long
enough to satisfy many typical requests on the obstack yet short enough
not to waste too much memory in the portion of the last chunk not yet used.

<!-- obstack.h -->
<!-- GNU -->
<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>This returns the chunk size of the given obstack. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Since this macro expands to an lvalue, you can specify a new chunk size by
assigning it a new value.  Doing so does not affect the chunks already
allocated, but will change the size of chunks allocated for that particular
obstack in the future.  It is unlikely to be useful to make the chunk size
smaller, but making it larger might improve efficiency if you are
allocating many objects whose size is comparable to the chunk size.  Here
is how to do so cleanly:

<pre class="smallexample">     if (obstack_chunk_size (obstack_ptr) &lt; <var>new-chunk-size</var>)
       obstack_chunk_size (obstack_ptr) = <var>new-chunk-size</var>;

<p>This function allocates memory which will be automatically reclaimed
after the procedure exits.  The <code>libiberty</code> implementation does not free
the memory immediately but will do so eventually during subsequent
calls to this function.  Memory is allocated using <code>xmalloc</code> under
normal circumstances.

        <p>The header file <samp><span class="file">alloca-conf.h</span></samp> can be used in conjunction with the
GNU Autoconf test <code>AC_FUNC_ALLOCA</code> to test for and properly make
available this function.  The <code>AC_FUNC_ALLOCA</code> test requires that
client code use a block of preprocessor code to be safe (see the Autoconf
manual for more); this header incorporates that logic and more, including
the possibility of a GCC built-in function.

like to write code that is portable to all systems the <code>pex</code>
functions support, consider using <code>pex_input_file</code> instead.

        <p>There are two opportunities for deadlock using
<code>pex_input_pipe</code>:

          <ul>
<li>Most systems' pipes can buffer only a fixed amount of data; a process
that writes to a full pipe blocks.  Thus, if you write to <samp><span class="file">fp</span></samp>
before starting the first process, you run the risk of blocking when
there is no child process yet to read the data and allow you to
continue.  <code>pex_input_pipe</code> makes no promises about the
size of the pipe's buffer, so if you need to write any data at all
before starting the first process in the pipeline, consider using
<code>pex_input_file</code> instead.

          <li>Using <code>pex_input_pipe</code> and <code>pex_read_output</code> together
may also cause deadlock.  If the output pipe fills up, so that each
program in the pipeline is waiting for the next to read more data, and
you fill the input pipe by writing more data to <var>fp</var>, then there
is no way to make progress: the only process that could read data from
the output pipe is you, but you are blocked on the input pipe.

        <p>There are two cases to consider when setting the name of the file to

the concatenation of <var>tempbase</var> and <var>outname</var>.  If
<var>tempbase</var> was <code>NULL</code>, then the output file name is a random
file name ending in <var>outname</var>.

          <li><code>PEX_SUFFIX</code> was not set in <var>flags</var>.  In this
case, if <var>outname</var> is not <code>NULL</code>, it is used as the output
file name.  If <var>outname</var> is <code>NULL</code>, and <var>tempbase</var> was
not NULL, the output file name is randomly chosen using
<var>tempbase</var>.  Otherwise the output file name is chosen completely
at random.
             </ol>

        <p><var>errname</var> is the file name to use for standard error output.  If
it is <code>NULL</code>, standard error is the same as the caller's. 
Otherwise, standard error is written to the named file.

value, or to 0 if there is no relevant <code>errno</code>.

        <p>Basically, we compare strings normally (character by character), until
we find a digit in each string - then we enter a special comparison
mode, where each sequence of digits is taken as a whole.  If we reach the
end of these two parts without noticing a difference, we return to the
standard comparison mode.  There are two types of numeric parts:
"integral" and "fractional" (those  begin with a '0'). The types
of the numeric parts affect the way we sort them:

          <ul>
<li>integral/integral: we compare values as you would expect.

          <li>fractional/integral: the fractional part is less than the integral one. 
Again, no surprise.

          <li>fractional/fractional: the things become a bit more complex. 
If the common prefix contains only leading zeroes, the longest part is less
than the other one; else the comparison behaves normally.

<p><a name="index-LGPL_002c-Lesser-General-Public-License-236"></a><div align="center">Version 2.1, February 1999</div>

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street - Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
     version number 2.1.]
</pre>
<h4 class="appendixsubsec">A.1.1 Preamble</h4>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software&mdash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software&mdash;typically libraries&mdash;of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

   <p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

   <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

   <p>We call this license the <dfn>Lesser</dfn> General Public License because it
does <em>Less</em> to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

   <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

   <p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&ldquo;work based on the library&rdquo; and a &ldquo;work that uses the library&rdquo;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Lesser General Public License (also called &ldquo;this License&rdquo;).  Each
licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>A &ldquo;library&rdquo; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     <p>The &ldquo;Library&rdquo;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &ldquo;work based on the
Library&rdquo; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)

     <p>&ldquo;Source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

     <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

     <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The modified work must itself be a software library.

          <li>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          <li>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

          <li>If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
          </ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

     <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

     <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     <li>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

     <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     <p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

     <li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

     <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     <li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     <p>However, linking a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &ldquo;work that uses the
library&rdquo;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

     <p>When a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

     <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

     <li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

     <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &ldquo;work that
uses the Library&rdquo;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

          <li>Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the
library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
version that the work was made with.

          <li>Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

          <li>If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

          <li>Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
          </ol>

     <p>For an executable, the required form of the &ldquo;work that uses the
Library&rdquo; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

     <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

     <li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

          <li>Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          </ol>

     <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

     <li>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

     <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

     <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     <li>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

     <li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&ldquo;any later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

     <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

     <div align="center">NO WARRANTY</div>

     <li>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     <li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
        </ol>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">A.1.2 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h4>

<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

   <p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301,
     USA.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre class="smallexample">     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library
     `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.
     
     <var>signature of Ty Coon</var>, 1 April 1990
     Ty Coon, President of Vice
</pre>
   <p>That's all there is to it!
