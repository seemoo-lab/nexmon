<h4 class="subsection">15.1.3 Having <span class="sc">gdb</span> Infer the Source Language</h4>

<p>To have <span class="sc">gdb</span> set the working language automatically, use
`<samp><span class="samp">set language local</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">set language auto</span></samp>'.  <span class="sc">gdb</span>
then infers the working language.  That is, when your program stops in a
frame (usually by encountering a breakpoint), <span class="sc">gdb</span> sets the
working language to the language recorded for the function in that
frame.  If the language for a frame is unknown (that is, if the function
or block corresponding to the frame was defined in a source file that
does not have a recognized extension), the current working language is
not changed, and <span class="sc">gdb</span> issues a warning.

   <p>This may not seem necessary for most programs, which are written
entirely in one source language.  However, program modules and libraries
written in one source language can be used by a main program written in
a different source language.  Using `<samp><span class="samp">set language auto</span></samp>' in this
case frees you from having to set the working language manually.
