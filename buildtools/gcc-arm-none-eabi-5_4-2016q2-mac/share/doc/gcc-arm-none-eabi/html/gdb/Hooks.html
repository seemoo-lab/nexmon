<h4 class="subsection">23.1.2 User-defined Command Hooks</h4>

<p><a name="index-command-hooks-1776"></a><a name="index-hooks_002c-for-commands-1777"></a><a name="index-hooks_002c-pre_002dcommand-1778"></a>
<a name="index-hook-1779"></a>You may define <dfn>hooks</dfn>, which are a special kind of user-defined
command.  Whenever you run the command `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', if the user-defined
command `<samp><span class="samp">hook-foo</span></samp>' exists, it is executed (with no arguments)
before that command.

   <p><a name="index-hooks_002c-post_002dcommand-1780"></a><a name="index-hookpost-1781"></a>A hook may also be defined which is run after the command you executed. 
Whenever you run the command `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>', if the user-defined command
`<samp><span class="samp">hookpost-foo</span></samp>' exists, it is executed (with no arguments) after
that command.  Post-execution hooks may exist simultaneously with
pre-execution hooks, for the same command.

   <p>It is valid for a hook to call the command which it hooks.  If this
occurs, the hook is not re-executed, thereby avoiding infinite recursion.

<!-- It would be nice if hookpost could be passed a parameter indicating -->
<!-- if the command it hooks executed properly or not.  FIXME! -->
<p><a name="index-stop_0040r_007b_002c-a-pseudo_002dcommand_007d-1782"></a>In addition, a pseudo-command, `<samp><span class="samp">stop</span></samp>' exists.  Defining
(`<samp><span class="samp">hook-stop</span></samp>') makes the associated commands execute every time
execution stops in your program: before breakpoint commands are run,
displays are printed, or the stack frame is printed.

   <p>For example, to ignore <code>SIGALRM</code> signals while
single-stepping, but treat them normally during normal execution,
you could define:

<pre class="smallexample">     define hook-stop
     handle SIGALRM nopass
     end
     
     define hook-run
     handle SIGALRM pass
     end
     
     define hook-continue
     handle SIGALRM pass
     end
</pre>
   <p>As a further example, to hook at the beginning and end of the <code>echo</code>
command, and to add extra text to the beginning and end of the message,
you could define:

<pre class="smallexample">     define hook-echo
     echo &lt;&lt;&lt;---
     end
     
     define hookpost-echo
     echo ---&gt;&gt;&gt;\n
     end
     
     (gdb) echo Hello World
     &lt;&lt;&lt;---Hello World---&gt;&gt;&gt;
     (gdb)
     
</pre>
   <p>You can define a hook for any single-word command in <span class="sc">gdb</span>, but
not for command aliases; you should define a hook for the basic command
name, e.g.  <code>backtrace</code> rather than <code>bt</code>. 
<!-- FIXME!  So how does Joe User discover whether a command is an alias -->
<!-- or not? -->
You can hook a multi-word command by adding <code>hook-</code> or
<code>hookpost-</code> to the last word of the command, e.g. 
`<samp><span class="samp">define target hook-remote</span></samp>' to add a hook to `<samp><span class="samp">target remote</span></samp>'.

   <p>If an error occurs during the execution of your hook, execution of
<span class="sc">gdb</span> commands stops and <span class="sc">gdb</span> issues a prompt
(before the command that you actually typed had a chance to run).

   <p>If you try to define a hook which does not match any known command, you
get a warning from the <code>define</code> command.
