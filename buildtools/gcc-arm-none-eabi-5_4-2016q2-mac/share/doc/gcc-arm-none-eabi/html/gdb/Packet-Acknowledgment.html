<h3 class="section">E.11 Packet Acknowledgment</h3>

<p><a name="index-acknowledgment_002c-for-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-3449"></a><a name="index-packet-acknowledgment_002c-for-_0040value_007bGDBN_007d-remote-3450"></a>By default, when either the host or the target machine receives a packet,
the first response expected is an acknowledgment: either `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' (to indicate
the package was received correctly) or `<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' (to request retransmission). 
This mechanism allows the <span class="sc">gdb</span> remote protocol to operate over
unreliable transport mechanisms, such as a serial line.

   <p>In cases where the transport mechanism is itself reliable (such as a pipe or
TCP connection), the `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'/`<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' acknowledgments are redundant. 
It may be desirable to disable them in that case to reduce communication
overhead, or for other reasons.  This can be accomplished by means of the
`<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>' packet; see <a href="QStartNoAckMode.html#QStartNoAckMode">QStartNoAckMode</a>.

   <p>When in no-acknowledgment mode, neither the stub nor <span class="sc">gdb</span> shall send or
expect `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'/`<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' protocol acknowledgments.  The packet
and response format still includes the normal checksum, as described in
<a href="Overview.html#Overview">Overview</a>, but the checksum may be ignored by the receiver.

   <p>If the stub supports `<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>' and prefers to operate in
no-acknowledgment mode, it should report that to <span class="sc">gdb</span>
by including `<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode+</span></samp>' in its response to `<samp><span class="samp">qSupported</span></samp>';
see <a href="qSupported.html#qSupported">qSupported</a>. 
If <span class="sc">gdb</span> also supports `<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>' and it has not been
disabled via the <code>set remote noack-packet off</code> command
(see <a href="Remote-Configuration.html#Remote-Configuration">Remote Configuration</a>),
<span class="sc">gdb</span> may then send a `<samp><span class="samp">QStartNoAckMode</span></samp>' packet to the stub. 
Only then may the stub actually turn off packet acknowledgments. 
<span class="sc">gdb</span> sends a final `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' acknowledgment of the stub's `<samp><span class="samp">OK</span></samp>'
response, which can be safely ignored by the stub.

   <p>Note that <code>set remote noack-packet</code> command only affects negotiation
between <span class="sc">gdb</span> and the stub when subsequent connections are made;
it does not affect the protocol acknowledgment state for any current
connection. 
Since `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>'/`<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>' acknowledgments are enabled by default when a
new connection is established,
there is also no protocol request to re-enable the acknowledgments
for the current connection, once disabled.
