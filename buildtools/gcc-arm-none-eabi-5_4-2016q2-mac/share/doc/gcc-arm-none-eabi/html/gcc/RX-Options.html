<h4 class="subsection">3.17.38 RX Options</h4>

<p><a name="index-RX-Options-2369"></a>
These command-line options are defined for RX targets:

     <dl>
<dt><code>-m64bit-doubles</code><dt><code>-m32bit-doubles</code><dd><a name="index-m64bit_002ddoubles-2370"></a><a name="index-m32bit_002ddoubles-2371"></a>Make the <code>double</code> data type be 64 bits (<samp><span class="option">-m64bit-doubles</span></samp>)
or 32 bits (<samp><span class="option">-m32bit-doubles</span></samp>) in size.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-m32bit-doubles</span></samp>.  <em>Note</em> RX floating-point hardware only
works on 32-bit values, which is why the default is
<samp><span class="option">-m32bit-doubles</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>-fpu</code><dt><code>-nofpu</code><dd><a name="index-fpu-2372"></a><a name="index-nofpu-2373"></a>Enables (<samp><span class="option">-fpu</span></samp>) or disables (<samp><span class="option">-nofpu</span></samp>) the use of RX
floating-point hardware.  The default is enabled for the RX600
series and disabled for the RX200 series.

     <p>Floating-point instructions are only generated for 32-bit floating-point
values, however, so the FPU hardware is not used for doubles if the
<samp><span class="option">-m64bit-doubles</span></samp> option is used.

     <p><em>Note</em> If the <samp><span class="option">-fpu</span></samp> option is enabled then
<samp><span class="option">-funsafe-math-optimizations</span></samp> is also enabled automatically. 
This is because the RX FPU instructions are themselves unsafe.

     <br><dt><code>-mcpu=</code><var>name</var><dd><a name="index-mcpu-2374"></a>Selects the type of RX CPU to be targeted.  Currently three types are
supported, the generic `<samp><span class="samp">RX600</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">RX200</span></samp>' series hardware and
the specific `<samp><span class="samp">RX610</span></samp>' CPU.  The default is `<samp><span class="samp">RX600</span></samp>'.

     <p>The only difference between `<samp><span class="samp">RX600</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">RX610</span></samp>' is that the
`<samp><span class="samp">RX610</span></samp>' does not support the <code>MVTIPL</code> instruction.

     <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">RX200</span></samp>' series does not have a hardware floating-point unit
and so <samp><span class="option">-nofpu</span></samp> is enabled by default when this type is
selected.

     <br><dt><code>-mbig-endian-data</code><dt><code>-mlittle-endian-data</code><dd><a name="index-mbig_002dendian_002ddata-2375"></a><a name="index-mlittle_002dendian_002ddata-2376"></a>Store data (but not code) in the big-endian format.  The default is
<samp><span class="option">-mlittle-endian-data</span></samp>, i.e. to store data in the little-endian
format.

     <br><dt><code>-msmall-data-limit=</code><var>N</var><dd><a name="index-msmall_002ddata_002dlimit-2377"></a>Specifies the maximum size in bytes of global and static variables
which can be placed into the small data area.  Using the small data
area can lead to smaller and faster code, but the size of area is
limited and it is up to the programmer to ensure that the area does
not overflow.  Also when the small data area is used one of the RX's
registers (usually <code>r13</code>) is reserved for use pointing to this
area, so it is no longer available for use by the compiler.  This
could result in slower and/or larger code if variables are pushed onto
the stack instead of being held in this register.

     <p>Note, common variables (variables that have not been initialized) and
constants are not placed into the small data area as they are assigned
to other sections in the output executable.

     <p>The default value is zero, which disables this feature.  Note, this
feature is not enabled by default with higher optimization levels
(<samp><span class="option">-O2</span></samp> etc) because of the potentially detrimental effects of
reserving a register.  It is up to the programmer to experiment and
discover whether this feature is of benefit to their program.  See the
description of the <samp><span class="option">-mpid</span></samp> option for a description of how the
actual register to hold the small data area pointer is chosen.

     <br><dt><code>-msim</code><dt><code>-mno-sim</code><dd><a name="index-msim-2378"></a><a name="index-mno_002dsim-2379"></a>Use the simulator runtime.  The default is to use the libgloss
board-specific runtime.

     <br><dt><code>-mas100-syntax</code><dt><code>-mno-as100-syntax</code><dd><a name="index-mas100_002dsyntax-2380"></a><a name="index-mno_002das100_002dsyntax-2381"></a>When generating assembler output use a syntax that is compatible with
Renesas's AS100 assembler.  This syntax can also be handled by the GAS
assembler, but it has some restrictions so it is not generated by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mmax-constant-size=</code><var>N</var><dd><a name="index-mmax_002dconstant_002dsize-2382"></a>Specifies the maximum size, in bytes, of a constant that can be used as
an operand in a RX instruction.  Although the RX instruction set does
allow constants of up to 4 bytes in length to be used in instructions,
a longer value equates to a longer instruction.  Thus in some
circumstances it can be beneficial to restrict the size of constants
that are used in instructions.  Constants that are too big are instead
placed into a constant pool and referenced via register indirection.

     <p>The value <var>N</var> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 0 (the default)
or 4 means that constants of any size are allowed.

     <br><dt><code>-mrelax</code><dd><a name="index-mrelax-2383"></a>Enable linker relaxation.  Linker relaxation is a process whereby the
linker attempts to reduce the size of a program by finding shorter
versions of various instructions.  Disabled by default.

     <br><dt><code>-mint-register=</code><var>N</var><dd><a name="index-mint_002dregister-2384"></a>Specify the number of registers to reserve for fast interrupt handler
functions.  The value <var>N</var> can be between 0 and 4.  A value of 1
means that register <code>r13</code> is reserved for the exclusive use
of fast interrupt handlers.  A value of 2 reserves <code>r13</code> and
<code>r12</code>.  A value of 3 reserves <code>r13</code>, <code>r12</code> and
<code>r11</code>, and a value of 4 reserves <code>r13</code> through <code>r10</code>. 
A value of 0, the default, does not reserve any registers.

     <br><dt><code>-msave-acc-in-interrupts</code><dd><a name="index-msave_002dacc_002din_002dinterrupts-2385"></a>Specifies that interrupt handler functions should preserve the
accumulator register.  This is only necessary if normal code might use
the accumulator register, for example because it performs 64-bit
multiplications.  The default is to ignore the accumulator as this
makes the interrupt handlers faster.

     <br><dt><code>-mpid</code><dt><code>-mno-pid</code><dd><a name="index-mpid-2386"></a><a name="index-mno_002dpid-2387"></a>Enables the generation of position independent data.  When enabled any
access to constant data is done via an offset from a base address
held in a register.  This allows the location of constant data to be
determined at run time without requiring the executable to be
relocated, which is a benefit to embedded applications with tight
memory constraints.  Data that can be modified is not affected by this
option.

     <p>Note, using this feature reserves a register, usually <code>r13</code>, for
the constant data base address.  This can result in slower and/or
larger code, especially in complicated functions.

     <p>The actual register chosen to hold the constant data base address
depends upon whether the <samp><span class="option">-msmall-data-limit</span></samp> and/or the
<samp><span class="option">-mint-register</span></samp> command-line options are enabled.  Starting
with register <code>r13</code> and proceeding downwards, registers are
allocated first to satisfy the requirements of <samp><span class="option">-mint-register</span></samp>,
then <samp><span class="option">-mpid</span></samp> and finally <samp><span class="option">-msmall-data-limit</span></samp>.  Thus it
is possible for the small data area register to be <code>r8</code> if both
<samp><span class="option">-mint-register=4</span></samp> and <samp><span class="option">-mpid</span></samp> are specified on the
command line.

     <p>By default this feature is not enabled.  The default can be restored
via the <samp><span class="option">-mno-pid</span></samp> command-line option.

     <br><dt><code>-mno-warn-multiple-fast-interrupts</code><dt><code>-mwarn-multiple-fast-interrupts</code><dd><a name="index-mno_002dwarn_002dmultiple_002dfast_002dinterrupts-2388"></a><a name="index-mwarn_002dmultiple_002dfast_002dinterrupts-2389"></a>Prevents GCC from issuing a warning message if it finds more than one
fast interrupt handler when it is compiling a file.  The default is to
issue a warning for each extra fast interrupt handler found, as the RX
only supports one such interrupt.

 </dl>

 <p><em>Note:</em> The generic GCC command-line option <samp><span class="option">-ffixed-</span><var>reg</var></samp>
has special significance to the RX port when used with the
<code>interrupt</code> function attribute.  This attribute indicates a
function intended to process fast interrupts.  GCC ensures
that it only uses the registers <code>r10</code>, <code>r11</code>, <code>r12</code>
and/or <code>r13</code> and only provided that the normal use of the
corresponding registers have been restricted via the
<samp><span class="option">-ffixed-</span><var>reg</var></samp> or <samp><span class="option">-mint-register</span></samp> command-line
options.
