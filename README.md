# What is nexmon?
Nexmon is our C-based firmware patching framework for Broadcom/Cypress WiFi chips 
that enables you to write your own firmware patches, for example, to enable monitor
mode with radiotap headers and frame injection.

Before we started to work on this repository, we developed patches for the Nexus 5 (with bcm4339 WiFi chip) in the [bcm-public](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/bcm-public)  repository and those for the Raspberry Pi 3 (with bcm43438 WiFi chip) in the [bcm-rpi3](https://github.com/seemoo-lab/bcm-rpi3) repository. To remove the development overhead of maintaining multiple separate repositories, we decided to merge them in this repository and add support for some additional devices. In contrast to the former repositories, here, you can only build the firmware patch without drivers and kernels. The Raspberry Pi 3 makes an exception, as here it is always required to also build the driver.

# WARNING

# Important changes
* Starting with commit 4f8697743dc46ffc37d87d960825367531baeef9 the brcmfmac driver for the RPi3 can now be used as a regular interface. You need to use nexutil to activate monitor mode (`nexutil -m2` for monitor mode with radiotap headers), which will automtically adjust the interface type.
* Starting with commit 184480edd6696392aae5f818f305f244606f2d17 you can choose different monitor mode options using nexutil. Use `nexutil -m1` to activate monitor mode without radiotap headers, `nexutil -m2` to activate it with radiotap headers. The numbers were chosen as non-Nexmon firmwares also support native monitor mode without radiotap headers by activating monitor mode with `nexutil -m1`.
* Starting with commit 1bcfdc95b4395c2e8bdd962791ae20c4ba602f5b we changed the nexutil interface. Instead of calling `nexutil -m true` to activate monitor mode, you should now write `nexutil -m1`. To get the current monitor mode state execute `nexutil -m` instead of `nexutil -n`.

# Steps to create your own firmware patches

## Build patches for bcm4330, bcm4339 and bcm4358 using a x86 computer running Linux (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04)
* Install some dependencies: `sudo apt-get install git gawk qpdf adb`
* **Only necessary for x86_64 systems**, install i386 libs: 

  ```
  sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libncurses5:i386 libstdc++6:i386
  ```
* Clone our repository: `git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon.git`
* In the root directory of the repository: `cd nexmon`
  * Setup the build environment: `source setup_env.sh`
  * Compile some build tools and extract the ucode and flashpatches from the original firmware files: `make`
* Go to the *patches* folder of your target device (e.g. bcm4339 for the Nexus 5): `cd patches/bcm4339/6_37_34_43/nexmon/`
  * Compile a patched firmware: `make`
  * Generate a backup of your original firmware file: `make backup-firmware`
  * Install the patched firmware on your smartphone: `make install-firmware` (make sure your smartphone is connected to your machine beforehand)

### Using the Monitor Mode patch
* Install at least *nexutil* and *libfakeioctl* from our utilities. The easiest way to do this is by using this app: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.tu_darmstadt.seemoo.nexmon. But you can also build it from the source by executing `make` in the *utilties* folder (Note: you will need the Android NDK properly installed for this).
* Connect to your Android phone using the ADB tools: `adb shell`
* Make sure you are **not** connected to an access point
* Use *nexutil* to enable monitor mode: `nexutil -m2`
* At this point the monitor mode is active. There is no need to call *airmon-ng*. 
* **Important:** Most tools need a Radiotap interface to work properly. *libfakeioctl* emulates this type of interface for you, therefore, use LD_PRELOAD to load this library when you call the favourite tool (e.g. tcpdump or airodump-ng): `LD_PRELOAD=libfakeioctl.so tcpdump -i wlan0`

### Using nexutil over UDP on Nexus 5
To be able to communicate with the firmware without root priviledges, we created a UDP interface accessible through the `libnexio`, which is also used by `nexutil`. You first have to prove to the firmware that you generally have root priviledges by setting a securtiy cookie. Then you can use it for UDP based connections. Your wlan0 interface also needs an IP address in the 192.168.222.0/24 range or you have to change the default nexutil `broadcast-ip`:
* Set the IP address of the wlan0 interface: `ifconfig wlan0 192.168.222.1 netmask 255.255.255.0`
* Set the security cookie as root: `nexutil -x<cookie (uint)>`
* Start a UDP connection for example to activate monitor mode: `nexutil -X<cookie> -m1`

## Build patches for bcm43438 on the RPI3/Zero W using Raspbian 8 (recommended)
* Make sure the following commands are executed as `root`
* Upgrade your Raspbian installation: `apt-get update && apt-get upgrade`
* Install the kernel headers to build the driver and some dependencies: `sudo apt install raspberrypi-kernel-headers git libgmp3-dev gawk qpdf`
* Clone our repository: `git clone https://github.com/seemoo-lab/nexmon.git`
* Go into the root directory of our repository: `cd nexmon`
  * Setup the build environment: `source setup_env.sh`
  * Compile some build tools and extract the ucode and flashpatches from the original firmware files: `make`
* Go to the *patches* folder for the bcm43438 chipset: `cd patches/bcm43438/7_45_41_26/nexmon/`
  * Compile a patched firmware: `make`
  * Generate a backup of your original firmware file: `make backup-firmware`
  * Install the patched firmware on your RPI3: `make install-firmware`
* Install nexutil: from the root directory of our repository switch to the 
  * libnexio filder: `cd utilities/libnexio/`. Compile libnexio: `make`
  * nexutil folder: `cd utilities/nexutil/`. Compile and install nexutil: `make && make install`.
* *Optional*: remove wpa_supplicant for better control over the WiFi interface: `apt-get remove wpasupplicant`

### Using the Monitor Mode patch
* ~~Our modified driver sets the interface in monitor mode as soon as the interface goes up: `ifconfig wlan0 up`~~
* In the default setting the brcmfmac driver can be used regularly as a WiFi station with out firmware. To activate monitor mode, execute `nexutil -m2`.
* At this point the monitor mode is active. There is no need to call *airmon-ng*. 
* The interface already set the Radiotap header, therefore, tools like *tcpdump* or *airodump-ng* can be used out of the box: `tcpdump -i wlan0`
* **Note:** It is not possible to connect to an access point anymore using our modified driver and firmware, if you whant to go back to the default behaviour you will need to load the original driver and firmware.
